<p>EXPLANATORY</p>
<p>IN this book a number of dialects are used, to wit: &nbsp;the
Missouri negro dialect; the extremest form of the backwoods
Southwestern dialect; the ordinary "Pike County" dialect; and four
modified varieties of this last. The shadings have not been done in
a haphazard fashion, or by guesswork; but painstakingly, and with
the trustworthy guidance and support of personal familiarity with
these several forms of speech.</p>
<p>I make this explanation for the reason that without it many
readers would suppose that all these characters were trying to talk
alike and not succeeding.</p>

<p>CHAPTER I.</p>
<p>YOU don't know about me without you have read a book by the name
of The Adventures of Tom Sawyer; but that ain't no matter.
&nbsp;That book was made by Mr. Mark Twain, and he told the truth,
mainly. &nbsp;There was things which he stretched, but mainly he
told the truth. &nbsp;That is nothing. &nbsp;I never seen anybody
but lied one time or another, without it was Aunt Polly, or the
widow, or maybe Mary. &nbsp;Aunt Polly&mdash;Tom's Aunt Polly, she
is&mdash;and Mary, and the Widow Douglas is all told about in that
book, which is mostly a true book, with some stretchers, as I said
before.</p>
<p>Now the way that the book winds up is this: &nbsp;Tom and me
found the money that the robbers hid in the cave, and it made us
rich. &nbsp;We got six thousand dollars apiece&mdash;all gold.
&nbsp;It was an awful sight of money when it was piled up.
&nbsp;Well, Judge Thatcher he took it and put it out at interest,
and it fetched us a dollar a day apiece all the year
round&mdash;more than a body could tell what to do with. &nbsp;The
Widow Douglas she took me for her son, and allowed she would
sivilize me; but it was rough living in the house all the time,
considering how dismal regular and decent the widow was in all her
ways; and so when I couldn't stand it no longer I lit out. &nbsp;I
got into my old rags and my sugar-hogshead again, and was free and
satisfied. &nbsp;But Tom Sawyer he hunted me up and said he was
going to start a band of robbers, and I might join if I would go
back to the widow and be respectable. &nbsp;So I went back.</p>
<p>The widow she cried over me, and called me a poor lost lamb, and
she called me a lot of other names, too, but she never meant no
harm by it. She put me in them new clothes again, and I couldn't do
nothing but sweat and sweat, and feel all cramped up. &nbsp;Well,
then, the old thing commenced again. &nbsp;The widow rung a bell
for supper, and you had to come to time. When you got to the table
you couldn't go right to eating, but you had to wait for the widow
to tuck down her head and grumble a little over the victuals,
though there warn't really anything the matter with
them,&mdash;that is, nothing only everything was cooked by itself.
&nbsp;In a barrel of odds and ends it is different; things get
mixed up, and the juice kind of swaps around, and the things go
better.</p>
<p>After supper she got out her book and learned me about Moses and
the Bulrushers, and I was in a sweat to find out all about him; but
by and by she let it out that Moses had been dead a considerable
long time; so then I didn't care no more about him, because I don't
take no stock in dead people.</p>
<br />

width="463" /><br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<p>Pretty soon I wanted to smoke, and asked the widow to let me.
&nbsp;But she wouldn't. &nbsp;She said it was a mean practice and
wasn't clean, and I must try to not do it any more. &nbsp;That is
just the way with some people. &nbsp;They get down on a thing when
they don't know nothing about it. &nbsp;Here she was a-bothering
about Moses, which was no kin to her, and no use to anybody, being
gone, you see, yet finding a power of fault with me for doing a
thing that had some good in it. &nbsp;And she took snuff, too; of
course that was all right, because she done it herself.</p>
<p>Her sister, Miss Watson, a tolerable slim old maid, with goggles
on, had just come to live with her, and took a set at me now with a
spelling-book. She worked me middling hard for about an hour, and
then the widow made her ease up. &nbsp;I couldn't stood it much
longer. &nbsp;Then for an hour it was deadly dull, and I was
fidgety. &nbsp;Miss Watson would say, "Don't put your feet up
there, Huckleberry;" and "Don't scrunch up like that,
Huckleberry&mdash;set up straight;" and pretty soon she would say,
"Don't gap and stretch like that, Huckleberry&mdash;why don't you
try to behave?" &nbsp;Then she told me all about the bad place, and
I said I wished I was there. She got mad then, but I didn't mean no
harm. &nbsp;All I wanted was to go somewheres; all I wanted was a
change, I warn't particular. &nbsp;She said it was wicked to say
what I said; said she wouldn't say it for the whole world; she was
going to live so as to go to the good place. &nbsp;Well, I couldn't
see no advantage in going where she was going, so I made up my mind
I wouldn't try for it. &nbsp;But I never said so, because it would
only make trouble, and wouldn't do no good.</p>
<br />
<br />
<a name="c01-19" id="c01-19"></a><br />
<br />
<img alt="c01-19.jpg (46K)" src="images/c01-19.jpg" height="544"
width="338" /><br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<p>Now she had got a start, and she went on and told me all about
the good place. &nbsp;She said all a body would have to do there
was to go around all day long with a harp and sing, forever and
ever. &nbsp;So I didn't think much of it. But I never said so.
&nbsp;I asked her if she reckoned Tom Sawyer would go there, and
she said not by a considerable sight. &nbsp;I was glad about that,
because I wanted him and me to be together.</p>
<p>Miss Watson she kept pecking at me, and it got tiresome and
lonesome. &nbsp;By and by they fetched the niggers in and had
prayers, and then everybody was off to bed. &nbsp;I went up to my
room with a piece of candle, and put it on the table. &nbsp;Then I
set down in a chair by the window and tried to think of something
cheerful, but it warn't no use. &nbsp;I felt so lonesome I most
wished I was dead. &nbsp;The stars were shining, and the leaves
rustled in the woods ever so mournful; and I heard an owl, away
off, who-whooing about somebody that was dead, and a whippowill and
a dog crying about somebody that was going to die; and the wind was
trying to whisper something to me, and I couldn't make out what it
was, and so it made the cold shivers run over me. Then away out in
the woods I heard that kind of a sound that a ghost makes when it
wants to tell about something that's on its mind and can't make
itself understood, and so can't rest easy in its grave, and has to
go about that way every night grieving. &nbsp;I got so down-hearted
and scared I did wish I had some company. &nbsp;Pretty soon a
spider went crawling up my shoulder, and I flipped it off and it
lit in the candle; and before I could budge it was all shriveled
up. &nbsp;I didn't need anybody to tell me that that was an awful
bad sign and would fetch me some bad luck, so I was scared and most
shook the clothes off of me. I got up and turned around in my
tracks three times and crossed my breast every time; and then I
tied up a little lock of my hair with a thread to keep witches
away. &nbsp;But I hadn't no confidence. &nbsp;You do that when
you've lost a horseshoe that you've found, instead of nailing it up
over the door, but I hadn't ever heard anybody say it was any way
to keep off bad luck when you'd killed a spider.</p>
<p>I set down again, a-shaking all over, and got out my pipe for a
smoke; for the house was all as still as death now, and so the
widow wouldn't know. Well, after a long time I heard the clock away
off in the town go boom&mdash;boom&mdash;boom&mdash;twelve licks;
and all still again&mdash;stiller than ever. Pretty soon I heard a
twig snap down in the dark amongst the trees&mdash;something was a
stirring. &nbsp;I set still and listened. &nbsp;Directly I could
just barely hear a "me-yow! me-yow!" down there. &nbsp;That was
good! &nbsp;Says I, "me-yow! me-yow!" as soft as I could, and then
I put out the light and scrambled out of the window on to the shed.
&nbsp;Then I slipped down to the ground and crawled in among the
trees, and, sure enough, there was Tom Sawyer waiting for me.</p>

CHAPTER II.</p>
<p>WE went tiptoeing along a path amongst the trees back towards
the end of the widow's garden, stooping down so as the branches
wouldn't scrape our heads. When we was passing by the kitchen I
fell over a root and made a noise. &nbsp;We scrouched down and laid
still. &nbsp;Miss Watson's big nigger, named Jim, was setting in
the kitchen door; we could see him pretty clear, because there was
a light behind him. &nbsp;He got up and stretched his neck out
about a minute, listening. &nbsp;Then he says:</p>
<p>"Who dah?"</p>
<p>He listened some more; then he come tiptoeing down and stood
right between us; we could a touched him, nearly. &nbsp;Well,
likely it was minutes and minutes that there warn't a sound, and we
all there so close together. &nbsp;There was a place on my ankle
that got to itching, but I dasn't scratch it; and then my ear begun
to itch; and next my back, right between my shoulders. &nbsp;Seemed
like I'd die if I couldn't scratch. &nbsp;Well, I've noticed that
thing plenty times since. &nbsp;If you are with the quality, or at
a funeral, or trying to go to sleep when you ain't sleepy&mdash;if
you are anywheres where it won't do for you to scratch, why you
will itch all over in upwards of a thousand places. Pretty soon Jim
says:</p>
<p>"Say, who is you? &nbsp;Whar is you? &nbsp;Dog my cats ef I
didn' hear sumf'n. Well, I know what I's gwyne to do: &nbsp;I's
gwyne to set down here and listen tell I hears it agin."</p>
<br />
<br />
<a name="c02-24" id="c02-24"></a><br />
<br />
<img alt="c02-24.jpg (38K)" src="images/c02-24.jpg" height="557"
width="303" /><br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<p>So he set down on the ground betwixt me and Tom. &nbsp;He leaned
his back up against a tree, and stretched his legs out till one of
them most touched one of mine. &nbsp;My nose begun to itch.
&nbsp;It itched till the tears come into my eyes. &nbsp;But I
dasn't scratch. &nbsp;Then it begun to itch on the inside. Next I
got to itching underneath. &nbsp;I didn't know how I was going to
set still. This miserableness went on as much as six or seven
minutes; but it seemed a sight longer than that. &nbsp;I was
itching in eleven different places now. &nbsp;I reckoned I couldn't
stand it more'n a minute longer, but I set my teeth hard and got
ready to try. &nbsp;Just then Jim begun to breathe heavy; next he
begun to snore&mdash;and then I was pretty soon comfortable
again.</p>
<p>Tom he made a sign to me&mdash;kind of a little noise with his
mouth&mdash;and we went creeping away on our hands and knees.
&nbsp;When we was ten foot off Tom whispered to me, and wanted to
tie Jim to the tree for fun. &nbsp;But I said no; he might wake and
make a disturbance, and then they'd find out I warn't in. Then Tom
said he hadn't got candles enough, and he would slip in the kitchen
and get some more. &nbsp;I didn't want him to try. &nbsp;I said Jim
might wake up and come. &nbsp;But Tom wanted to resk it; so we slid
in there and got three candles, and Tom laid five cents on the
table for pay. Then we got out, and I was in a sweat to get away;
but nothing would do Tom but he must crawl to where Jim was, on his
hands and knees, and play something on him. &nbsp;I waited, and it
seemed a good while, everything was so still and lonesome.</p>
<p>As soon as Tom was back we cut along the path, around the garden
fence, and by and by fetched up on the steep top of the hill the
other side of the house. &nbsp;Tom said he slipped Jim's hat off of
his head and hung it on a limb right over him, and Jim stirred a
little, but he didn't wake. Afterwards Jim said the witches be
witched him and put him in a trance, and rode him all over the
State, and then set him under the trees again, and hung his hat on
a limb to show who done it. &nbsp;And next time Jim told it he said
they rode him down to New Orleans; and, after that, every time he
told it he spread it more and more, till by and by he said they
rode him all over the world, and tired him most to death, and his
back was all over saddle-boils. &nbsp;Jim was monstrous proud about
it, and he got so he wouldn't hardly notice the other niggers.
&nbsp;Niggers would come miles to hear Jim tell about it, and he
was more looked up to than any nigger in that country.
&nbsp;Strange niggers would stand with their mouths open and look
him all over, same as if he was a wonder. &nbsp;Niggers is always
talking about witches in the dark by the kitchen fire; but whenever
one was talking and letting on to know all about such things, Jim
would happen in and say, "Hm! &nbsp;What you know 'bout witches?"
and that nigger was corked up and had to take a back seat.
&nbsp;Jim always kept that five-center piece round his neck with a
string, and said it was a charm the devil give to him with his own
hands, and told him he could cure anybody with it and fetch witches
whenever he wanted to just by saying something to it; but he never
told what it was he said to it. &nbsp;Niggers would come from all
around there and give Jim anything they had, just for a sight of
that five-center piece; but they wouldn't touch it, because the
devil had had his hands on it. &nbsp;Jim was most ruined for a
servant, because he got stuck up on account of having seen the
devil and been rode by witches.</p>
<p>Well, when Tom and me got to the edge of the hilltop we looked
away down into the village and could see three or four lights
twinkling, where there was sick folks, maybe; and the stars over us
was sparkling ever so fine; and down by the village was the river,
a whole mile broad, and awful still and grand. &nbsp;We went down
the hill and found Jo Harper and Ben Rogers, and two or three more
of the boys, hid in the old tanyard. &nbsp;So we unhitched a skiff
and pulled down the river two mile and a half, to the big scar on
the hillside, and went ashore.</p>
<p>We went to a clump of bushes, and Tom made everybody swear to
keep the secret, and then showed them a hole in the hill, right in
the thickest part of the bushes. &nbsp;Then we lit the candles, and
crawled in on our hands and knees. &nbsp;We went about two hundred
yards, and then the cave opened up. Tom poked about amongst the
passages, and pretty soon ducked under a wall where you wouldn't a
noticed that there was a hole. &nbsp;We went along a narrow place
and got into a kind of room, all damp and sweaty and cold, and
there we stopped. &nbsp;Tom says:</p>
<p>"Now, we'll start this band of robbers and call it Tom Sawyer's
Gang. Everybody that wants to join has got to take an oath, and
write his name in blood."</p>
<br />
<br />
<a name="c02-25" id="c02-25"></a><br />
<br />
<img alt="c02-25.jpg (68K)" src="images/c02-25.jpg" height="444"
width="665" /><br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<p>Everybody was willing. &nbsp;So Tom got out a sheet of paper
that he had wrote the oath on, and read it. &nbsp;It swore every
boy to stick to the band, and never tell any of the secrets; and if
anybody done anything to any boy in the band, whichever boy was
ordered to kill that person and his family must do it, and he
mustn't eat and he mustn't sleep till he had killed them and hacked
a cross in their breasts, which was the sign of the band. And
nobody that didn't belong to the band could use that mark, and if
he did he must be sued; and if he done it again he must be killed.
&nbsp;And if anybody that belonged to the band told the secrets, he
must have his throat cut, and then have his carcass burnt up and
the ashes scattered all around, and his name blotted off of the
list with blood and never mentioned again by the gang, but have a
curse put on it and be forgot forever.</p>
<p>Everybody said it was a real beautiful oath, and asked Tom if he
got it out of his own head. &nbsp;He said, some of it, but the rest
was out of pirate-books and robber-books, and every gang that was
high-toned had it.</p>
<p>Some thought it would be good to kill the FAMILIES of boys that
told the secrets. &nbsp;Tom said it was a good idea, so he took a
pencil and wrote it in. Then Ben Rogers says:</p>
<p>"Here's Huck Finn, he hain't got no family; what you going to do
'bout him?"</p>
<p>"Well, hain't he got a father?" says Tom Sawyer.</p>
<p>"Yes, he's got a father, but you can't never find him these
days. &nbsp;He used to lay drunk with the hogs in the tanyard, but
he hain't been seen in these parts for a year or more."</p>
<p>They talked it over, and they was going to rule me out, because
they said every boy must have a family or somebody to kill, or else
it wouldn't be fair and square for the others. &nbsp;Well, nobody
could think of anything to do&mdash;everybody was stumped, and set
still. &nbsp;I was most ready to cry; but all at once I thought of
a way, and so I offered them Miss Watson&mdash;they could kill her.
&nbsp;Everybody said:</p>
<p>"Oh, she'll do. &nbsp;That's all right. &nbsp;Huck can come
in."</p>
<p>Then they all stuck a pin in their fingers to get blood to sign
with, and I made my mark on the paper.</p>
<p>"Now," says Ben Rogers, "what's the line of business of this
Gang?"</p>
<p>"Nothing only robbery and murder," Tom said.</p>
<p>"But who are we going to rob?&mdash;houses, or cattle,
or&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Stuff! stealing cattle and such things ain't robbery; it's
burglary," says Tom Sawyer. &nbsp;"We ain't burglars. &nbsp;That
ain't no sort of style. &nbsp;We are highwaymen. &nbsp;We stop
stages and carriages on the road, with masks on, and kill the
people and take their watches and money."</p>
<p>"Must we always kill the people?"</p>
<p>"Oh, certainly. &nbsp;It's best. &nbsp;Some authorities think
different, but mostly it's considered best to kill
them&mdash;except some that you bring to the cave here, and keep
them till they're ransomed."</p>
<p>"Ransomed? &nbsp;What's that?"</p>
<p>"I don't know. &nbsp;But that's what they do. &nbsp;I've seen it
in books; and so of course that's what we've got to do."</p>
<p>"But how can we do it if we don't know what it is?"</p>
<p>"Why, blame it all, we've GOT to do it. &nbsp;Don't I tell you
it's in the books? &nbsp;Do you want to go to doing different from
what's in the books, and get things all muddled up?"</p>
<p>"Oh, that's all very fine to SAY, Tom Sawyer, but how in the
nation are these fellows going to be ransomed if we don't know how
to do it to them?&mdash;that's the thing I want to get at.
&nbsp;Now, what do you reckon it is?"</p>
<p>"Well, I don't know. &nbsp;But per'aps if we keep them till
they're ransomed, it means that we keep them till they're
dead."</p>
<p>"Now, that's something LIKE. &nbsp;That'll answer. &nbsp;Why
couldn't you said that before? &nbsp;We'll keep them till they're
ransomed to death; and a bothersome lot they'll be,
too&mdash;eating up everything, and always trying to get
loose."</p>
<p>"How you talk, Ben Rogers. &nbsp;How can they get loose when
there's a guard over them, ready to shoot them down if they move a
peg?"</p>
<p>"A guard! &nbsp;Well, that IS good. &nbsp;So somebody's got to
set up all night and never get any sleep, just so as to watch them.
&nbsp;I think that's foolishness. Why can't a body take a club and
ransom them as soon as they get here?"</p>
<p>"Because it ain't in the books so&mdash;that's why. &nbsp;Now,
Ben Rogers, do you want to do things regular, or don't
you?&mdash;that's the idea. &nbsp;Don't you reckon that the people
that made the books knows what's the correct thing to do? &nbsp;Do
you reckon YOU can learn 'em anything? &nbsp;Not by a good deal.
No, sir, we'll just go on and ransom them in the regular way."</p>
<p>"All right. &nbsp;I don't mind; but I say it's a fool way,
anyhow. &nbsp;Say, do we kill the women, too?"</p>
<p>"Well, Ben Rogers, if I was as ignorant as you I wouldn't let
on. &nbsp;Kill the women? &nbsp;No; nobody ever saw anything in the
books like that. &nbsp;You fetch them to the cave, and you're
always as polite as pie to them; and by and by they fall in love
with you, and never want to go home any more."</p>
<p>"Well, if that's the way I'm agreed, but I don't take no stock
in it. Mighty soon we'll have the cave so cluttered up with women,
and fellows waiting to be ransomed, that there won't be no place
for the robbers. But go ahead, I ain't got nothing to say."</p>
<p>Little Tommy Barnes was asleep now, and when they waked him up
he was scared, and cried, and said he wanted to go home to his ma,
and didn't want to be a robber any more.</p>
<p>So they all made fun of him, and called him cry-baby, and that
made him mad, and he said he would go straight and tell all the
secrets. &nbsp;But Tom give him five cents to keep quiet, and said
we would all go home and meet next week, and rob somebody and kill
some people.</p>
<p>Ben Rogers said he couldn't get out much, only Sundays, and so
he wanted to begin next Sunday; but all the boys said it would be
wicked to do it on Sunday, and that settled the thing. &nbsp;They
agreed to get together and fix a day as soon as they could, and
then we elected Tom Sawyer first captain and Jo Harper second
captain of the Gang, and so started home.</p>
<p>I clumb up the shed and crept into my window just before day was
breaking. My new clothes was all greased up and clayey, and I was
dog-tired.</p>

CHAPTER III.</p>
<p>WELL, I got a good going-over in the morning from old Miss
Watson on account of my clothes; but the widow she didn't scold,
but only cleaned off the grease and clay, and looked so sorry that
I thought I would behave awhile if I could. &nbsp;Then Miss Watson
she took me in the closet and prayed, but nothing come of it.
&nbsp;She told me to pray every day, and whatever I asked for I
would get it. &nbsp;But it warn't so. &nbsp;I tried it. Once I got
a fish-line, but no hooks. &nbsp;It warn't any good to me without
hooks. &nbsp;I tried for the hooks three or four times, but somehow
I couldn't make it work. &nbsp;By and by, one day, I asked Miss
Watson to try for me, but she said I was a fool. &nbsp;She never
told me why, and I couldn't make it out no way.</p>
<p>I set down one time back in the woods, and had a long think
about it. &nbsp;I says to myself, if a body can get anything they
pray for, why don't Deacon Winn get back the money he lost on pork?
&nbsp;Why can't the widow get back her silver snuffbox that was
stole? &nbsp;Why can't Miss Watson fat up? No, says I to my self,
there ain't nothing in it. &nbsp;I went and told the widow about
it, and she said the thing a body could get by praying for it was
"spiritual gifts." &nbsp;This was too many for me, but she told me
what she meant&mdash;I must help other people, and do everything I
could for other people, and look out for them all the time, and
never think about myself. This was including Miss Watson, as I took
it. &nbsp;I went out in the woods and turned it over in my mind a
long time, but I couldn't see no advantage about it&mdash;except
for the other people; so at last I reckoned I wouldn't worry about
it any more, but just let it go. &nbsp;Sometimes the widow would
take me one side and talk about Providence in a way to make a
body's mouth water; but maybe next day Miss Watson would take hold
and knock it all down again. &nbsp;I judged I could see that there
was two Providences, and a poor chap would stand considerable show
with the widow's Providence, but if Miss Watson's got him there
warn't no help for him any more. &nbsp;I thought it all out, and
reckoned I would belong to the widow's if he wanted me, though I
couldn't make out how he was a-going to be any better off then than
what he was before, seeing I was so ignorant, and so kind of
low-down and ornery.</p>
<p>Pap he hadn't been seen for more than a year, and that was
comfortable for me; I didn't want to see him no more. &nbsp;He used
to always whale me when he was sober and could get his hands on me;
though I used to take to the woods most of the time when he was
around. &nbsp;Well, about this time he was found in the river
drownded, about twelve mile above town, so people said. &nbsp;They
judged it was him, anyway; said this drownded man was just his
size, and was ragged, and had uncommon long hair, which was all
like pap; but they couldn't make nothing out of the face, because
it had been in the water so long it warn't much like a face at all.
&nbsp;They said he was floating on his back in the water.
&nbsp;They took him and buried him on the bank. &nbsp;But I warn't
comfortable long, because I happened to think of something. &nbsp;I
knowed mighty well that a drownded man don't float on his back, but
on his face. &nbsp;So I knowed, then, that this warn't pap, but a
woman dressed up in a man's clothes. &nbsp;So I was uncomfortable
again. &nbsp;I judged the old man would turn up again by and by,
though I wished he wouldn't.</p>
<p>We played robber now and then about a month, and then I
resigned. &nbsp;All the boys did. &nbsp;We hadn't robbed nobody,
hadn't killed any people, but only just pretended. &nbsp;We used to
hop out of the woods and go charging down on hog-drivers and women
in carts taking garden stuff to market, but we never hived any of
them. &nbsp;Tom Sawyer called the hogs "ingots," and he called the
turnips and stuff "julery," and we would go to the cave and powwow
over what we had done, and how many people we had killed and
marked. &nbsp;But I couldn't see no profit in it. &nbsp;One time
Tom sent a boy to run about town with a blazing stick, which he
called a slogan (which was the sign for the Gang to get together),
and then he said he had got secret news by his spies that next day
a whole parcel of Spanish merchants and rich A-rabs was going to
camp in Cave Hollow with two hundred elephants, and six hundred
camels, and over a thousand "sumter" mules, all loaded down with
di'monds, and they didn't have only a guard of four hundred
soldiers, and so we would lay in ambuscade, as he called it, and
kill the lot and scoop the things. &nbsp;He said we must slick up
our swords and guns, and get ready. &nbsp;He never could go after
even a turnip-cart but he must have the swords and guns all scoured
up for it, though they was only lath and broomsticks, and you might
scour at them till you rotted, and then they warn't worth a
mouthful of ashes more than what they was before. &nbsp;I didn't
believe we could lick such a crowd of Spaniards and A-rabs, but I
wanted to see the camels and elephants, so I was on hand next day,
Saturday, in the ambuscade; and when we got the word we rushed out
of the woods and down the hill. &nbsp;But there warn't no Spaniards
and A-rabs, and there warn't no camels nor no elephants. &nbsp;It
warn't anything but a Sunday-school picnic, and only a primer-class
at that. &nbsp;We busted it up, and chased the children up the
hollow; but we never got anything but some doughnuts and jam,
though Ben Rogers got a rag doll, and Jo Harper got a hymn-book and
a tract; and then the teacher charged in, and made us drop
everything and cut.</p>

<p>&nbsp;I didn't see no di'monds, and I told Tom Sawyer so.
&nbsp;He said there was loads of them there, anyway; and he said
there was A-rabs there, too, and elephants and things. &nbsp;I
said, why couldn't we see them, then? &nbsp;He said if I warn't so
ignorant, but had read a book called Don Quixote, I would know
without asking. &nbsp;He said it was all done by enchantment.
&nbsp;He said there was hundreds of soldiers there, and elephants
and treasure, and so on, but we had enemies which he called
magicians; and they had turned the whole thing into an infant
Sunday-school, just out of spite. &nbsp;I said, all right; then the
thing for us to do was to go for the magicians. &nbsp;Tom Sawyer
said I was a numskull.</p>
<p>"Why," said he, "a magician could call up a lot of genies, and
they would hash you up like nothing before you could say Jack
Robinson. &nbsp;They are as tall as a tree and as big around as a
church."</p>
<p>"Well," I says, "s'pose we got some genies to help
US&mdash;can't we lick the other crowd then?"</p>
<p>"How you going to get them?"</p>
<p>"I don't know. &nbsp;How do THEY get them?"</p>
<p>"Why, they rub an old tin lamp or an iron ring, and then the
genies come tearing in, with the thunder and lightning a-ripping
around and the smoke a-rolling, and everything they're told to do
they up and do it. &nbsp;They don't think nothing of pulling a
shot-tower up by the roots, and belting a Sunday-school
superintendent over the head with it&mdash;or any other man."</p>
<p>"Who makes them tear around so?"</p>
<p>"Why, whoever rubs the lamp or the ring. &nbsp;They belong to
whoever rubs the lamp or the ring, and they've got to do whatever
he says. &nbsp;If he tells them to build a palace forty miles long
out of di'monds, and fill it full of chewing-gum, or whatever you
want, and fetch an emperor's daughter from China for you to marry,
they've got to do it&mdash;and they've got to do it before sun-up
next morning, too. &nbsp;And more: &nbsp;they've got to waltz that
palace around over the country wherever you want it, you
understand."</p>
<p>"Well," says I, "I think they are a pack of flat-heads for not
keeping the palace themselves 'stead of fooling them away like
that. &nbsp;And what's more&mdash;if I was one of them I would see
a man in Jericho before I would drop my business and come to him
for the rubbing of an old tin lamp."</p>
<p>"How you talk, Huck Finn. &nbsp;Why, you'd HAVE to come when he
rubbed it, whether you wanted to or not."</p>
<p>"What! and I as high as a tree and as big as a church? &nbsp;All
right, then; I WOULD come; but I lay I'd make that man climb the
highest tree there was in the country."</p>
<p>"Shucks, it ain't no use to talk to you, Huck Finn. &nbsp;You
don't seem to know anything, somehow&mdash;perfect saphead."</p>
<p>I thought all this over for two or three days, and then I
reckoned I would see if there was anything in it. &nbsp;I got an
old tin lamp and an iron ring, and went out in the woods and rubbed
and rubbed till I sweat like an Injun, calculating to build a
palace and sell it; but it warn't no use, none of the genies come.
&nbsp;So then I judged that all that stuff was only just one of Tom
Sawyer's lies. &nbsp;I reckoned he believed in the A-rabs and the
elephants, but as for me I think different. &nbsp;It had all the
marks of a Sunday-school.</p>

CHAPTER IV.</p>
<p>WELL, three or four months run along, and it was well into the
winter now. I had been to school most all the time and could spell
and read and write just a little, and could say the multiplication
table up to six times seven is thirty-five, and I don't reckon I
could ever get any further than that if I was to live forever.
&nbsp;I don't take no stock in mathematics, anyway.</p>
<p>At first I hated the school, but by and by I got so I could
stand it. Whenever I got uncommon tired I played hookey, and the
hiding I got next day done me good and cheered me up. &nbsp;So the
longer I went to school the easier it got to be. &nbsp;I was
getting sort of used to the widow's ways, too, and they warn't so
raspy on me. &nbsp;Living in a house and sleeping in a bed pulled
on me pretty tight mostly, but before the cold weather I used to
slide out and sleep in the woods sometimes, and so that was a rest
to me. &nbsp;I liked the old ways best, but I was getting so I
liked the new ones, too, a little bit. The widow said I was coming
along slow but sure, and doing very satisfactory. &nbsp;She said
she warn't ashamed of me.</p>
<p>One morning I happened to turn over the salt-cellar at
breakfast. &nbsp;I reached for some of it as quick as I could to
throw over my left shoulder and keep off the bad luck, but Miss
Watson was in ahead of me, and crossed me off. She says, "Take your
hands away, Huckleberry; what a mess you are always making!"
&nbsp;The widow put in a good word for me, but that warn't going to
keep off the bad luck, I knowed that well enough. &nbsp;I started
out, after breakfast, feeling worried and shaky, and wondering
where it was going to fall on me, and what it was going to be.
&nbsp;There is ways to keep off some kinds of bad luck, but this
wasn't one of them kind; so I never tried to do anything, but just
poked along low-spirited and on the watch-out.</p>
<p>I went down to the front garden and clumb over the stile where
you go through the high board fence. &nbsp;There was an inch of new
snow on the ground, and I seen somebody's tracks. &nbsp;They had
come up from the quarry and stood around the stile a while, and
then went on around the garden fence. &nbsp;It was funny they
hadn't come in, after standing around so. &nbsp;I couldn't make it
out. &nbsp;It was very curious, somehow. &nbsp;I was going to
follow around, but I stooped down to look at the tracks first.
&nbsp;I didn't notice anything at first, but next I did.
&nbsp;There was a cross in the left boot-heel made with big nails,
to keep off the devil.</p>
<p>I was up in a second and shinning down the hill. &nbsp;I looked
over my shoulder every now and then, but I didn't see nobody.
&nbsp;I was at Judge Thatcher's as quick as I could get there.
&nbsp;He said:</p>
<p>"Why, my boy, you are all out of breath. &nbsp;Did you come for
your interest?"</p>
<p>"No, sir," I says; "is there some for me?"</p>
<p>"Oh, yes, a half-yearly is in last night&mdash;over a hundred
and fifty dollars. &nbsp;Quite a fortune for you. &nbsp;You had
better let me invest it along with your six thousand, because if
you take it you'll spend it."</p>
<p>"No, sir," I says, "I don't want to spend it. &nbsp;I don't want
it at all&mdash;nor the six thousand, nuther. &nbsp;I want you to
take it; I want to give it to you&mdash;the six thousand and
all."</p>
<br />
<br />
<a name="c04-36" id="c04-36"></a><br />
<br />
<img alt="c04-36.jpg (50K)" src="images/c04-36.jpg" height="557"
width="491" /><br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<p>He looked surprised. &nbsp;He couldn't seem to make it out.
&nbsp;He says:</p>
<p>"Why, what can you mean, my boy?"</p>
<p>I says, "Don't you ask me no questions about it, please.
&nbsp;You'll take it&mdash;won't you?"</p>
<p>He says:</p>
<p>"Well, I'm puzzled. &nbsp;Is something the matter?"</p>
<p>"Please take it," says I, "and don't ask me nothing&mdash;then I
won't have to tell no lies."</p>
<p>He studied a while, and then he says:</p>
<p>"Oho-o! &nbsp;I think I see. &nbsp;You want to SELL all your
property to me&mdash;not give it. &nbsp;That's the correct
idea."</p>
<p>Then he wrote something on a paper and read it over, and
says:</p>
<p>"There; you see it says 'for a consideration.' &nbsp;That means
I have bought it of you and paid you for it. &nbsp;Here's a dollar
for you. &nbsp;Now you sign it."</p>
<p>So I signed it, and left.</p>
<p>Miss Watson's nigger, Jim, had a hair-ball as big as your fist,
which had been took out of the fourth stomach of an ox, and he used
to do magic with it. &nbsp;He said there was a spirit inside of it,
and it knowed everything. &nbsp;So I went to him that night and
told him pap was here again, for I found his tracks in the snow.
&nbsp;What I wanted to know was, what he was going to do, and was
he going to stay? &nbsp;Jim got out his hair-ball and said
something over it, and then he held it up and dropped it on the
floor. &nbsp;It fell pretty solid, and only rolled about an inch.
&nbsp;Jim tried it again, and then another time, and it acted just
the same. &nbsp;Jim got down on his knees, and put his ear against
it and listened. &nbsp;But it warn't no use; he said it wouldn't
talk. He said sometimes it wouldn't talk without money. &nbsp;I
told him I had an old slick counterfeit quarter that warn't no good
because the brass showed through the silver a little, and it
wouldn't pass nohow, even if the brass didn't show, because it was
so slick it felt greasy, and so that would tell on it every time.
&nbsp;(I reckoned I wouldn't say nothing about the dollar I got
from the judge.) I said it was pretty bad money, but maybe the
hair-ball would take it, because maybe it wouldn't know the
difference. &nbsp;Jim smelt it and bit it and rubbed it, and said
he would manage so the hair-ball would think it was good. &nbsp;He
said he would split open a raw Irish potato and stick the quarter
in between and keep it there all night, and next morning you
couldn't see no brass, and it wouldn't feel greasy no more, and so
anybody in town would take it in a minute, let alone a hair-ball.
&nbsp;Well, I knowed a potato would do that before, but I had
forgot it.</p>

<br />
<br />
<br />
<p>Jim put the quarter under the hair-ball, and got down and
listened again. This time he said the hair-ball was all right.
&nbsp;He said it would tell my whole fortune if I wanted it to.
&nbsp;I says, go on. &nbsp;So the hair-ball talked to Jim, and Jim
told it to me. &nbsp;He says:</p>
<p>"Yo' ole father doan' know yit what he's a-gwyne to do.
&nbsp;Sometimes he spec he'll go 'way, en den agin he spec he'll
stay. &nbsp;De bes' way is to res' easy en let de ole man take his
own way. &nbsp;Dey's two angels hoverin' roun' 'bout him. &nbsp;One
uv 'em is white en shiny, en t'other one is black. De white one
gits him to go right a little while, den de black one sail in en
bust it all up. &nbsp;A body can't tell yit which one gwyne to
fetch him at de las'. &nbsp;But you is all right. &nbsp;You gwyne
to have considable trouble in yo' life, en considable joy.
&nbsp;Sometimes you gwyne to git hurt, en sometimes you gwyne to
git sick; but every time you's gwyne to git well agin. &nbsp;Dey's
two gals flyin' 'bout you in yo' life. &nbsp;One uv 'em's light en
t'other one is dark. One is rich en t'other is po'. &nbsp;You's
gwyne to marry de po' one fust en de rich one by en by. &nbsp;You
wants to keep 'way fum de water as much as you kin, en don't run no

<p>When I lit my candle and went up to my room that night there sat
pap his own self!</p>

CHAPTER V.</p>
<p>I HAD shut the door to. &nbsp;Then I turned around and there he
was. &nbsp;I used to be scared of him all the time, he tanned me so
much. &nbsp;I reckoned I was scared now, too; but in a minute I see
I was mistaken&mdash;that is, after the first jolt, as you may say,
when my breath sort of hitched, he being so unexpected; but right
away after I see I warn't scared of him worth bothring about.</p>
<p>He was most fifty, and he looked it. &nbsp;His hair was long and
tangled and greasy, and hung down, and you could see his eyes
shining through like he was behind vines. &nbsp;It was all black,
no gray; so was his long, mixed-up whiskers. &nbsp;There warn't no
color in his face, where his face showed; it was white; not like
another man's white, but a white to make a body sick, a white to
make a body's flesh crawl&mdash;a tree-toad white, a fish-belly
white. &nbsp;As for his clothes&mdash;just rags, that was all.
&nbsp;He had one ankle resting on t'other knee; the boot on that
foot was busted, and two of his toes stuck through, and he worked
them now and then. &nbsp;His hat was laying on the floor&mdash;an
old black slouch with the top caved in, like a lid.</p>
<p>I stood a-looking at him; he set there a-looking at me, with his
chair tilted back a little. &nbsp;I set the candle down. &nbsp;I
noticed the window was up; so he had clumb in by the shed. &nbsp;He
kept a-looking me all over. &nbsp;By and by he says:</p>
<p>"Starchy clothes&mdash;very. &nbsp;You think you're a good deal
of a big-bug, DON'T you?"</p>
<p>"Maybe I am, maybe I ain't," I says.</p>
<p>"Don't you give me none o' your lip," says he. &nbsp;"You've put
on considerable many frills since I been away. &nbsp;I'll take you
down a peg before I get done with you. &nbsp;You're educated, too,
they say&mdash;can read and write. &nbsp;You think you're better'n
your father, now, don't you, because he can't? &nbsp;I'LL take it
out of you. &nbsp;Who told you you might meddle with such hifalut'n
foolishness, hey?&mdash;who told you you could?"</p>
<p>"The widow. &nbsp;She told me."</p>
<p>"The widow, hey?&mdash;and who told the widow she could put in
her shovel about a thing that ain't none of her business?"</p>
<p>"Nobody never told her."</p>
<p>"Well, I'll learn her how to meddle. &nbsp;And looky
here&mdash;you drop that school, you hear? &nbsp;I'll learn people
to bring up a boy to put on airs over his own father and let on to
be better'n what HE is. &nbsp;You lemme catch you fooling around
that school again, you hear? &nbsp;Your mother couldn't read, and
she couldn't write, nuther, before she died. &nbsp;None of the
family couldn't before THEY died. &nbsp;I can't; and here you're
a-swelling yourself up like this. &nbsp;I ain't the man to stand
it&mdash;you hear? Say, lemme hear you read."</p>
<p>I took up a book and begun something about General Washington
and the wars. When I'd read about a half a minute, he fetched the
book a whack with his hand and knocked it across the house.
&nbsp;He says:</p>
<p>"It's so. &nbsp;You can do it. &nbsp;I had my doubts when you
told me. &nbsp;Now looky here; you stop that putting on frills.
&nbsp;I won't have it. &nbsp;I'll lay for you, my smarty; and if I
catch you about that school I'll tan you good. First you know
you'll get religion, too. &nbsp;I never see such a son."</p>
<p>He took up a little blue and yaller picture of some cows and a
boy, and says:</p>
<p>"What's this?"</p>
<p>"It's something they give me for learning my lessons good."</p>
<p>He tore it up, and says:</p>
<p>"I'll give you something better&mdash;I'll give you a
cowhide."</p>
<p>He set there a-mumbling and a-growling a minute, and then he
says:</p>
<p>"AIN'T you a sweet-scented dandy, though? &nbsp;A bed; and
bedclothes; and a look'n'-glass; and a piece of carpet on the
floor&mdash;and your own father got to sleep with the hogs in the
tanyard. &nbsp;I never see such a son. &nbsp;I bet I'll take some
o' these frills out o' you before I'm done with you. Why, there
ain't no end to your airs&mdash;they say you're rich.
&nbsp;Hey?&mdash;how's that?"</p>

width="445" /><br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<p>"They lie&mdash;that's how."</p>
<p>"Looky here&mdash;mind how you talk to me; I'm a-standing about
all I can stand now&mdash;so don't gimme no sass. &nbsp;I've been
in town two days, and I hain't heard nothing but about you bein'
rich. &nbsp;I heard about it away down the river, too. &nbsp;That's
why I come. &nbsp;You git me that money to-morrow&mdash;I want
it."</p>
<p>"I hain't got no money."</p>
<p>"It's a lie. &nbsp;Judge Thatcher's got it. &nbsp;You git it.
&nbsp;I want it."</p>
<p>"I hain't got no money, I tell you. &nbsp;You ask Judge
Thatcher; he'll tell you the same."</p>
<p>"All right. &nbsp;I'll ask him; and I'll make him pungle, too,
or I'll know the reason why. &nbsp;Say, how much you got in your
pocket? &nbsp;I want it."</p>
<p>"I hain't got only a dollar, and I want that to&mdash;"</p>
<p>"It don't make no difference what you want it for&mdash;you just
shell it out."</p>
<p>He took it and bit it to see if it was good, and then he said he
was going down town to get some whisky; said he hadn't had a drink
all day. When he had got out on the shed he put his head in again,
and cussed me for putting on frills and trying to be better than
him; and when I reckoned he was gone he come back and put his head
in again, and told me to mind about that school, because he was
going to lay for me and lick me if I didn't drop that.</p>
<p>Next day he was drunk, and he went to Judge Thatcher's and
bullyragged him, and tried to make him give up the money; but he
couldn't, and then he swore he'd make the law force him.</p>
<p>The judge and the widow went to law to get the court to take me
away from him and let one of them be my guardian; but it was a new
judge that had just come, and he didn't know the old man; so he
said courts mustn't interfere and separate families if they could
help it; said he'd druther not take a child away from its father.
&nbsp;So Judge Thatcher and the widow had to quit on the
business.</p>
<p>That pleased the old man till he couldn't rest. &nbsp;He said
he'd cowhide me till I was black and blue if I didn't raise some
money for him. &nbsp;I borrowed three dollars from Judge Thatcher,
and pap took it and got drunk, and went a-blowing around and
cussing and whooping and carrying on; and he kept it up all over
town, with a tin pan, till most midnight; then they jailed him, and
next day they had him before court, and jailed him again for a
week. &nbsp;But he said HE was satisfied; said he was boss of his
son, and he'd make it warm for HIM.</p>
<p>When he got out the new judge said he was a-going to make a man
of him. So he took him to his own house, and dressed him up clean
and nice, and had him to breakfast and dinner and supper with the
family, and was just old pie to him, so to speak. &nbsp;And after
supper he talked to him about temperance and such things till the
old man cried, and said he'd been a fool, and fooled away his life;
but now he was a-going to turn over a new leaf and be a man nobody
wouldn't be ashamed of, and he hoped the judge would help him and
not look down on him. &nbsp;The judge said he could hug him for
them words; so he cried, and his wife she cried again; pap said
he'd been a man that had always been misunderstood before, and the
judge said he believed it. &nbsp;The old man said that what a man
wanted that was down was sympathy, and the judge said it was so; so
they cried again. &nbsp;And when it was bedtime the old man rose up
and held out his hand, and says:</p>
<p>"Look at it, gentlemen and ladies all; take a-hold of it; shake
it. There's a hand that was the hand of a hog; but it ain't so no
more; it's the hand of a man that's started in on a new life,
and'll die before he'll go back. &nbsp;You mark them
words&mdash;don't forget I said them. &nbsp;It's a clean hand now;
shake it&mdash;don't be afeard."</p>

<br />
<br />
<br />
<p>So they shook it, one after the other, all around, and cried.
&nbsp;The judge's wife she kissed it. &nbsp;Then the old man he
signed a pledge&mdash;made his mark. The judge said it was the
holiest time on record, or something like that. Then they tucked
the old man into a beautiful room, which was the spare room, and in
the night some time he got powerful thirsty and clumb out on to the
porch-roof and slid down a stanchion and traded his new coat for a
jug of forty-rod, and clumb back again and had a good old time; and
towards daylight he crawled out again, drunk as a fiddler, and
rolled off the porch and broke his left arm in two places, and was
most froze to death when somebody found him after sun-up. &nbsp;And
when they come to look at that spare room they had to take
soundings before they could navigate it.</p>
<p>The judge he felt kind of sore. &nbsp;He said he reckoned a body
could reform the old man with a shotgun, maybe, but he didn't know
no other way.</p>

CHAPTER VI.</p>
<p>WELL, pretty soon the old man was up and around again, and then
he went for Judge Thatcher in the courts to make him give up that
money, and he went for me, too, for not stopping school. &nbsp;He
catched me a couple of times and thrashed me, but I went to school
just the same, and dodged him or outrun him most of the time.
&nbsp;I didn't want to go to school much before, but I reckoned I'd
go now to spite pap. &nbsp;That law trial was a slow
business&mdash;appeared like they warn't ever going to get started
on it; so every now and then I'd borrow two or three dollars off of
the judge for him, to keep from getting a cowhiding. &nbsp;Every
time he got money he got drunk; and every time he got drunk he
raised Cain around town; and every time he raised Cain he got
jailed. &nbsp;He was just suited&mdash;this kind of thing was right
in his line.</p>
<p>He got to hanging around the widow's too much and so she told
him at last that if he didn't quit using around there she would
make trouble for him. Well, WASN'T he mad? &nbsp;He said he would
show who was Huck Finn's boss. &nbsp;So he watched out for me one
day in the spring, and catched me, and took me up the river about
three mile in a skiff, and crossed over to the Illinois shore where
it was woody and there warn't no houses but an old log hut in a
place where the timber was so thick you couldn't find it if you
didn't know where it was.</p>
<p>He kept me with him all the time, and I never got a chance to
run off. We lived in that old cabin, and he always locked the door
and put the key under his head nights. &nbsp;He had a gun which he
had stole, I reckon, and we fished and hunted, and that was what we
lived on. &nbsp;Every little while he locked me in and went down to
the store, three miles, to the ferry, and traded fish and game for
whisky, and fetched it home and got drunk and had a good time, and
licked me. &nbsp;The widow she found out where I was by and by, and
she sent a man over to try to get hold of me; but pap drove him off
with the gun, and it warn't long after that till I was used to
being where I was, and liked it&mdash;all but the cowhide part.</p>
<p>It was kind of lazy and jolly, laying off comfortable all day,
smoking and fishing, and no books nor study. &nbsp;Two months or
more run along, and my clothes got to be all rags and dirt, and I
didn't see how I'd ever got to like it so well at the widow's,
where you had to wash, and eat on a plate, and comb up, and go to
bed and get up regular, and be forever bothering over a book, and
have old Miss Watson pecking at you all the time. &nbsp;I didn't
want to go back no more. &nbsp;I had stopped cussing, because the
widow didn't like it; but now I took to it again because pap hadn't
no objections. &nbsp;It was pretty good times up in the woods
there, take it all around.</p>
<br />
<br />
<a name="c06-46" id="c06-46"></a><br />
<br />
<img alt="c06-46.jpg (60K)" src="images/c06-46.jpg" height="449"
width="587" /><br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<p>But by and by pap got too handy with his hick'ry, and I couldn't
stand it. I was all over welts. &nbsp;He got to going away so much,
too, and locking me in. &nbsp;Once he locked me in and was gone
three days. &nbsp;It was dreadful lonesome. &nbsp;I judged he had
got drownded, and I wasn't ever going to get out any more. &nbsp;I
was scared. &nbsp;I made up my mind I would fix up some way to
leave there. &nbsp;I had tried to get out of that cabin many a
time, but I couldn't find no way. &nbsp;There warn't a window to it
big enough for a dog to get through. &nbsp;I couldn't get up the
chimbly; it was too narrow. &nbsp;The door was thick, solid oak
slabs. &nbsp;Pap was pretty careful not to leave a knife or
anything in the cabin when he was away; I reckon I had hunted the
place over as much as a hundred times; well, I was most all the
time at it, because it was about the only way to put in the time.
&nbsp;But this time I found something at last; I found an old rusty
wood-saw without any handle; it was laid in between a rafter and
the clapboards of the roof. I greased it up and went to work.
&nbsp;There was an old horse-blanket nailed against the logs at the
far end of the cabin behind the table, to keep the wind from
blowing through the chinks and putting the candle out. &nbsp;I got
under the table and raised the blanket, and went to work to saw a
section of the big bottom log out&mdash;big enough to let me
through. &nbsp;Well, it was a good long job, but I was getting
towards the end of it when I heard pap's gun in the woods. &nbsp;I
got rid of the signs of my work, and dropped the blanket and hid my
saw, and pretty soon pap come in.</p>
<p>Pap warn't in a good humor&mdash;so he was his natural self.
&nbsp;He said he was down town, and everything was going wrong.
&nbsp;His lawyer said he reckoned he would win his lawsuit and get
the money if they ever got started on the trial; but then there was
ways to put it off a long time, and Judge Thatcher knowed how to do
it. And he said people allowed there'd be another trial to get me
away from him and give me to the widow for my guardian, and they
guessed it would win this time. &nbsp;This shook me up
considerable, because I didn't want to go back to the widow's any
more and be so cramped up and sivilized, as they called it.
&nbsp;Then the old man got to cussing, and cussed everything and
everybody he could think of, and then cussed them all over again to
make sure he hadn't skipped any, and after that he polished off
with a kind of a general cuss all round, including a considerable
parcel of people which he didn't know the names of, and so called
them what's-his-name when he got to them, and went right along with
his cussing.</p>
<p>He said he would like to see the widow get me. &nbsp;He said he
would watch out, and if they tried to come any such game on him he
knowed of a place six or seven mile off to stow me in, where they
might hunt till they dropped and they couldn't find me. &nbsp;That
made me pretty uneasy again, but only for a minute; I reckoned I
wouldn't stay on hand till he got that chance.</p>
<p>The old man made me go to the skiff and fetch the things he had
got. There was a fifty-pound sack of corn meal, and a side of
bacon, ammunition, and a four-gallon jug of whisky, and an old book
and two newspapers for wadding, besides some tow. &nbsp;I toted up
a load, and went back and set down on the bow of the skiff to rest.
&nbsp;I thought it all over, and I reckoned I would walk off with
the gun and some lines, and take to the woods when I run away.
&nbsp;I guessed I wouldn't stay in one place, but just tramp right
across the country, mostly night times, and hunt and fish to keep
alive, and so get so far away that the old man nor the widow
couldn't ever find me any more. &nbsp;I judged I would saw out and
leave that night if pap got drunk enough, and I reckoned he would.
&nbsp;I got so full of it I didn't notice how long I was staying
till the old man hollered and asked me whether I was asleep or
drownded.</p>

width="446" /><br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<p>I got the things all up to the cabin, and then it was about
dark. &nbsp;While I was cooking supper the old man took a swig or
two and got sort of warmed up, and went to ripping again. &nbsp;He
had been drunk over in town, and laid in the gutter all night, and
he was a sight to look at. &nbsp;A body would a thought he was
Adam&mdash;he was just all mud. &nbsp;Whenever his liquor begun to
work he most always went for the govment, this time he says:</p>
<p>"Call this a govment! why, just look at it and see what it's
like. Here's the law a-standing ready to take a man's son away from
him&mdash;a man's own son, which he has had all the trouble and all
the anxiety and all the expense of raising. &nbsp;Yes, just as that
man has got that son raised at last, and ready to go to work and
begin to do suthin' for HIM and give him a rest, the law up and
goes for him. &nbsp;And they call THAT govment! &nbsp;That ain't
all, nuther. &nbsp;The law backs that old Judge Thatcher up and
helps him to keep me out o' my property. &nbsp;Here's what the law
does: &nbsp;The law takes a man worth six thousand dollars and
up'ards, and jams him into an old trap of a cabin like this, and
lets him go round in clothes that ain't fitten for a hog. They call
that govment! &nbsp;A man can't get his rights in a govment like
this. Sometimes I've a mighty notion to just leave the country for
good and all. Yes, and I TOLD 'em so; I told old Thatcher so to his
face. &nbsp;Lots of 'em heard me, and can tell what I said.
&nbsp;Says I, for two cents I'd leave the blamed country and never
come a-near it agin. &nbsp;Them's the very words. &nbsp;I says look
at my hat&mdash;if you call it a hat&mdash;but the lid raises up
and the rest of it goes down till it's below my chin, and then it
ain't rightly a hat at all, but more like my head was shoved up
through a jint o' stove-pipe. &nbsp;Look at it, says I&mdash;such a
hat for me to wear&mdash;one of the wealthiest men in this town if
I could git my rights.</p>
<p>"Oh, yes, this is a wonderful govment, wonderful. &nbsp;Why,
looky here. There was a free nigger there from Ohio&mdash;a
mulatter, most as white as a white man. &nbsp;He had the whitest
shirt on you ever see, too, and the shiniest hat; and there ain't a
man in that town that's got as fine clothes as what he had; and he
had a gold watch and chain, and a silver-headed cane&mdash;the
awfulest old gray-headed nabob in the State. &nbsp;And what do you
think? &nbsp;They said he was a p'fessor in a college, and could
talk all kinds of languages, and knowed everything. &nbsp;And that
ain't the wust. They said he could VOTE when he was at home.
&nbsp;Well, that let me out. Thinks I, what is the country a-coming
to? &nbsp;It was 'lection day, and I was just about to go and vote
myself if I warn't too drunk to get there; but when they told me
there was a State in this country where they'd let that nigger
vote, I drawed out. &nbsp;I says I'll never vote agin. &nbsp;Them's
the very words I said; they all heard me; and the country may rot
for all me&mdash;I'll never vote agin as long as I live. &nbsp;And
to see the cool way of that nigger&mdash;why, he wouldn't a give me
the road if I hadn't shoved him out o' the way. &nbsp;I says to the
people, why ain't this nigger put up at auction and
sold?&mdash;that's what I want to know. &nbsp;And what do you
reckon they said? Why, they said he couldn't be sold till he'd been
in the State six months, and he hadn't been there that long yet.
&nbsp;There, now&mdash;that's a specimen. &nbsp;They call that a
govment that can't sell a free nigger till he's been in the State
six months. &nbsp;Here's a govment that calls itself a govment, and
lets on to be a govment, and thinks it is a govment, and yet's got
to set stock-still for six whole months before it can take a hold
of a prowling, thieving, infernal, white-shirted free nigger,
and&mdash;"</p>
<p>Pap was agoing on so he never noticed where his old limber legs
was taking him to, so he went head over heels over the tub of salt
pork and barked both shins, and the rest of his speech was all the
hottest kind of language&mdash;mostly hove at the nigger and the
govment, though he give the tub some, too, all along, here and
there. &nbsp;He hopped around the cabin considerable, first on one
leg and then on the other, holding first one shin and then the
other one, and at last he let out with his left foot all of a
sudden and fetched the tub a rattling kick. &nbsp;But it warn't
good judgment, because that was the boot that had a couple of his
toes leaking out of the front end of it; so now he raised a howl
that fairly made a body's hair raise, and down he went in the dirt,
and rolled there, and held his toes; and the cussing he done then
laid over anything he had ever done previous. &nbsp;He said so his
own self afterwards. &nbsp;He had heard old Sowberry Hagan in his
best days, and he said it laid over him, too; but I reckon that was
sort of piling it on, maybe.</p>
<p>After supper pap took the jug, and said he had enough whisky
there for two drunks and one delirium tremens. &nbsp;That was
always his word. &nbsp;I judged he would be blind drunk in about an
hour, and then I would steal the key, or saw myself out, one or
t'other. &nbsp;He drank and drank, and tumbled down on his blankets
by and by; but luck didn't run my way. &nbsp;He didn't go sound
asleep, but was uneasy. &nbsp;He groaned and moaned and thrashed
around this way and that for a long time. &nbsp;At last I got so
sleepy I couldn't keep my eyes open all I could do, and so before I
knowed what I was about I was sound asleep, and the candle
burning.</p>
<br />

width="444" /><br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<p>I don't know how long I was asleep, but all of a sudden there
was an awful scream and I was up. &nbsp;There was pap looking wild,
and skipping around every which way and yelling about snakes.
&nbsp;He said they was crawling up his legs; and then he would give
a jump and scream, and say one had bit him on the cheek&mdash;but I
couldn't see no snakes. &nbsp;He started and run round and round
the cabin, hollering "Take him off! take him off! he's biting me on
the neck!" &nbsp;I never see a man look so wild in the eyes. Pretty
soon he was all fagged out, and fell down panting; then he rolled
over and over wonderful fast, kicking things every which way, and
striking and grabbing at the air with his hands, and screaming and
saying there was devils a-hold of him. &nbsp;He wore out by and by,
and laid still a while, moaning. &nbsp;Then he laid stiller, and
didn't make a sound. &nbsp;I could hear the owls and the wolves
away off in the woods, and it seemed terrible still. &nbsp;He was
laying over by the corner. By and by he raised up part way and
listened, with his head to one side. &nbsp;He says, very low:</p>
<p>"Tramp&mdash;tramp&mdash;tramp; that's the dead;
tramp&mdash;tramp&mdash;tramp; they're coming after me; but I won't
go. &nbsp;Oh, they're here! don't touch me&mdash;don't! hands
off&mdash;they're cold; let go. &nbsp;Oh, let a poor devil
alone!"</p>
<p>Then he went down on all fours and crawled off, begging them to
let him alone, and he rolled himself up in his blanket and wallowed
in under the old pine table, still a-begging; and then he went to
crying. &nbsp;I could hear him through the blanket.</p>
<p>By and by he rolled out and jumped up on his feet looking wild,
and he see me and went for me. &nbsp;He chased me round and round
the place with a clasp-knife, calling me the Angel of Death, and
saying he would kill me, and then I couldn't come for him no more.
&nbsp;I begged, and told him I was only Huck; but he laughed SUCH a
screechy laugh, and roared and cussed, and kept on chasing me up.
&nbsp;Once when I turned short and dodged under his arm he made a
grab and got me by the jacket between my shoulders, and I thought I
was gone; but I slid out of the jacket quick as lightning, and
saved myself. Pretty soon he was all tired out, and dropped down
with his back against the door, and said he would rest a minute and
then kill me. He put his knife under him, and said he would sleep
and get strong, and then he would see who was who.</p>
<p>So he dozed off pretty soon. &nbsp;By and by I got the old
split-bottom chair and clumb up as easy as I could, not to make any
noise, and got down the gun. &nbsp;I slipped the ramrod down it to
make sure it was loaded, then I laid it across the turnip barrel,
pointing towards pap, and set down behind it to wait for him to
stir. &nbsp;And how slow and still the time did drag along.</p>

CHAPTER VII.</p>
<p>"GIT up! &nbsp;What you 'bout?"</p>
<p>I opened my eyes and looked around, trying to make out where I
was. &nbsp;It was after sun-up, and I had been sound asleep.
&nbsp;Pap was standing over me looking sour and sick, too. &nbsp;He
says:</p>
<p>"What you doin' with this gun?"</p>
<p>I judged he didn't know nothing about what he had been doing, so
I says:</p>
<p>"Somebody tried to get in, so I was laying for him."</p>
<p>"Why didn't you roust me out?"</p>
<p>"Well, I tried to, but I couldn't; I couldn't budge you."</p>
<p>"Well, all right. &nbsp;Don't stand there palavering all day,
but out with you and see if there's a fish on the lines for
breakfast. &nbsp;I'll be along in a minute."</p>
<p>He unlocked the door, and I cleared out up the river-bank.
&nbsp;I noticed some pieces of limbs and such things floating down,
and a sprinkling of bark; so I knowed the river had begun to rise.
&nbsp;I reckoned I would have great times now if I was over at the
town. &nbsp;The June rise used to be always luck for me; because as
soon as that rise begins here comes cordwood floating down, and
pieces of log rafts&mdash;sometimes a dozen logs together; so all
you have to do is to catch them and sell them to the wood-yards and
the sawmill.</p>
<p>I went along up the bank with one eye out for pap and t'other
one out for what the rise might fetch along. &nbsp;Well, all at
once here comes a canoe; just a beauty, too, about thirteen or
fourteen foot long, riding high like a duck. &nbsp;I shot
head-first off of the bank like a frog, clothes and all on, and
struck out for the canoe. &nbsp;I just expected there'd be somebody
laying down in it, because people often done that to fool folks,
and when a chap had pulled a skiff out most to it they'd raise up
and laugh at him. &nbsp;But it warn't so this time. &nbsp;It was a
drift-canoe sure enough, and I clumb in and paddled her ashore.
&nbsp;Thinks I, the old man will be glad when he sees
this&mdash;she's worth ten dollars. &nbsp;But when I got to shore
pap wasn't in sight yet, and as I was running her into a little
creek like a gully, all hung over with vines and willows, I struck
another idea: &nbsp;I judged I'd hide her good, and then, 'stead of
taking to the woods when I run off, I'd go down the river about
fifty mile and camp in one place for good, and not have such a
rough time tramping on foot.</p>
<br />
<br />
<a name="c07-54" id="c07-54"></a><br />
<br />
<img alt="c07-54.jpg (79K)" src="images/c07-54.jpg" height="476"
width="594" /><br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<p>It was pretty close to the shanty, and I thought I heard the old
man coming all the time; but I got her hid; and then I out and
looked around a bunch of willows, and there was the old man down
the path a piece just drawing a bead on a bird with his gun.
&nbsp;So he hadn't seen anything.</p>
<p>When he got along I was hard at it taking up a "trot" line.
&nbsp;He abused me a little for being so slow; but I told him I
fell in the river, and that was what made me so long. &nbsp;I
knowed he would see I was wet, and then he would be asking
questions. &nbsp;We got five catfish off the lines and went
home.</p>
<p>While we laid off after breakfast to sleep up, both of us being
about wore out, I got to thinking that if I could fix up some way
to keep pap and the widow from trying to follow me, it would be a
certainer thing than trusting to luck to get far enough off before
they missed me; you see, all kinds of things might happen.
&nbsp;Well, I didn't see no way for a while, but by and by pap
raised up a minute to drink another barrel of water, and he
says:</p>
<p>"Another time a man comes a-prowling round here you roust me
out, you hear? That man warn't here for no good. &nbsp;I'd a shot
him. &nbsp;Next time you roust me out, you hear?"</p>
<p>Then he dropped down and went to sleep again; but what he had
been saying give me the very idea I wanted. &nbsp;I says to myself,
I can fix it now so nobody won't think of following me.</p>
<p>About twelve o'clock we turned out and went along up the bank.
&nbsp;The river was coming up pretty fast, and lots of driftwood
going by on the rise. By and by along comes part of a log
raft&mdash;nine logs fast together. &nbsp;We went out with the
skiff and towed it ashore. &nbsp;Then we had dinner. Anybody but
pap would a waited and seen the day through, so as to catch more
stuff; but that warn't pap's style. &nbsp;Nine logs was enough for
one time; he must shove right over to town and sell. &nbsp;So he
locked me in and took the skiff, and started off towing the raft
about half-past three. &nbsp;I judged he wouldn't come back that
night. &nbsp;I waited till I reckoned he had got a good start; then
I out with my saw, and went to work on that log again. &nbsp;Before
he was t'other side of the river I was out of the hole; him and his
raft was just a speck on the water away off yonder.</p>
<p>I took the sack of corn meal and took it to where the canoe was
hid, and shoved the vines and branches apart and put it in; then I
done the same with the side of bacon; then the whisky-jug. &nbsp;I
took all the coffee and sugar there was, and all the ammunition; I
took the wadding; I took the bucket and gourd; I took a dipper and
a tin cup, and my old saw and two blankets, and the skillet and the
coffee-pot. &nbsp;I took fish-lines and matches and other
things&mdash;everything that was worth a cent. &nbsp;I cleaned out
the place. &nbsp;I wanted an axe, but there wasn't any, only the
one out at the woodpile, and I knowed why I was going to leave
that. &nbsp;I fetched out the gun, and now I was done.</p>
<p>I had wore the ground a good deal crawling out of the hole and
dragging out so many things. &nbsp;So I fixed that as good as I
could from the outside by scattering dust on the place, which
covered up the smoothness and the sawdust. &nbsp;Then I fixed the
piece of log back into its place, and put two rocks under it and
one against it to hold it there, for it was bent up at that place
and didn't quite touch ground. &nbsp;If you stood four or five foot
away and didn't know it was sawed, you wouldn't never notice it;
and besides, this was the back of the cabin, and it warn't likely
anybody would go fooling around there.</p>
<p>It was all grass clear to the canoe, so I hadn't left a track.
&nbsp;I followed around to see. &nbsp;I stood on the bank and
looked out over the river. &nbsp;All safe. &nbsp;So I took the gun
and went up a piece into the woods, and was hunting around for some
birds when I see a wild pig; hogs soon went wild in them bottoms
after they had got away from the prairie farms. I shot this fellow
and took him into camp.</p>

<br />
<br />
<br />
<p>I took the axe and smashed in the door. &nbsp;I beat it and
hacked it considerable a-doing it. &nbsp;I fetched the pig in, and
took him back nearly to the table and hacked into his throat with
the axe, and laid him down on the ground to bleed; I say ground
because it was ground&mdash;hard packed, and no boards. &nbsp;Well,
next I took an old sack and put a lot of big rocks in it&mdash;all
I could drag&mdash;and I started it from the pig, and dragged it to
the door and through the woods down to the river and dumped it in,
and down it sunk, out of sight. &nbsp;You could easy see that
something had been dragged over the ground. &nbsp;I did wish Tom
Sawyer was there; I knowed he would take an interest in this kind
of business, and throw in the fancy touches. &nbsp;Nobody could
spread himself like Tom Sawyer in such a thing as that.</p>
<p>Well, last I pulled out some of my hair, and blooded the axe
good, and stuck it on the back side, and slung the axe in the
corner. &nbsp;Then I took up the pig and held him to my breast with
my jacket (so he couldn't drip) till I got a good piece below the
house and then dumped him into the river. &nbsp;Now I thought of
something else. &nbsp;So I went and got the bag of meal and my old
saw out of the canoe, and fetched them to the house. &nbsp;I took
the bag to where it used to stand, and ripped a hole in the bottom
of it with the saw, for there warn't no knives and forks on the
place&mdash;pap done everything with his clasp-knife about the
cooking. &nbsp;Then I carried the sack about a hundred yards across
the grass and through the willows east of the house, to a shallow
lake that was five mile wide and full of rushes&mdash;and ducks
too, you might say, in the season. &nbsp;There was a slough or a
creek leading out of it on the other side that went miles away, I
don't know where, but it didn't go to the river. &nbsp;The meal
sifted out and made a little track all the way to the lake. &nbsp;I
dropped pap's whetstone there too, so as to look like it had been
done by accident. Then I tied up the rip in the meal sack with a
string, so it wouldn't leak no more, and took it and my saw to the
canoe again.</p>
<p>It was about dark now; so I dropped the canoe down the river
under some willows that hung over the bank, and waited for the moon
to rise. &nbsp;I made fast to a willow; then I took a bite to eat,
and by and by laid down in the canoe to smoke a pipe and lay out a
plan. &nbsp;I says to myself, they'll follow the track of that
sackful of rocks to the shore and then drag the river for me.
&nbsp;And they'll follow that meal track to the lake and go
browsing down the creek that leads out of it to find the robbers
that killed me and took the things. &nbsp;They won't ever hunt the
river for anything but my dead carcass. They'll soon get tired of
that, and won't bother no more about me. &nbsp;All right; I can
stop anywhere I want to. Jackson's Island is good enough for me; I
know that island pretty well, and nobody ever comes there.
&nbsp;And then I can paddle over to town nights, and slink around
and pick up things I want. Jackson's Island's the place.</p>
<p>I was pretty tired, and the first thing I knowed I was asleep.
&nbsp;When I woke up I didn't know where I was for a minute.
&nbsp;I set up and looked around, a little scared. &nbsp;Then I
remembered. &nbsp;The river looked miles and miles across.
&nbsp;The moon was so bright I could a counted the drift logs that
went a-slipping along, black and still, hundreds of yards out from
shore. Everything was dead quiet, and it looked late, and SMELT
late. You know what I mean&mdash;I don't know the words to put it
in.</p>
<p>I took a good gap and a stretch, and was just going to unhitch
and start when I heard a sound away over the water. &nbsp;I
listened. &nbsp;Pretty soon I made it out. &nbsp;It was that dull
kind of a regular sound that comes from oars working in rowlocks
when it's a still night. &nbsp;I peeped out through the willow
branches, and there it was&mdash;a skiff, away across the water.
&nbsp;I couldn't tell how many was in it. &nbsp;It kept a-coming,
and when it was abreast of me I see there warn't but one man in it.
&nbsp;Think's I, maybe it's pap, though I warn't expecting him.
&nbsp;He dropped below me with the current, and by and by he came
a-swinging up shore in the easy water, and he went by so close I
could a reached out the gun and touched him. &nbsp;Well, it WAS
pap, sure enough&mdash;and sober, too, by the way he laid his
oars.</p>
<p>I didn't lose no time. &nbsp;The next minute I was a-spinning
down stream soft but quick in the shade of the bank. &nbsp;I made
two mile and a half, and then struck out a quarter of a mile or
more towards the middle of the river, because pretty soon I would
be passing the ferry landing, and people might see me and hail me.
&nbsp;I got out amongst the driftwood, and then laid down in the
bottom of the canoe and let her float.</p>

width="601" /><br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<p>&nbsp;I laid there, and had a good rest and a smoke out of my
pipe, looking away into the sky; not a cloud in it. &nbsp;The sky
looks ever so deep when you lay down on your back in the moonshine;
I never knowed it before. &nbsp;And how far a body can hear on the
water such nights! &nbsp;I heard people talking at the ferry
landing. I heard what they said, too&mdash;every word of it.
&nbsp;One man said it was getting towards the long days and the
short nights now. &nbsp;T'other one said THIS warn't one of the
short ones, he reckoned&mdash;and then they laughed, and he said it
over again, and they laughed again; then they waked up another
fellow and told him, and laughed, but he didn't laugh; he ripped
out something brisk, and said let him alone. &nbsp;The first fellow
said he 'lowed to tell it to his old woman&mdash;she would think it
was pretty good; but he said that warn't nothing to some things he
had said in his time. I heard one man say it was nearly three
o'clock, and he hoped daylight wouldn't wait more than about a week
longer. &nbsp;After that the talk got further and further away, and
I couldn't make out the words any more; but I could hear the
mumble, and now and then a laugh, too, but it seemed a long ways
off.</p>
<p>I was away below the ferry now. &nbsp;I rose up, and there was
Jackson's Island, about two mile and a half down stream, heavy
timbered and standing up out of the middle of the river, big and
dark and solid, like a steamboat without any lights. &nbsp;There
warn't any signs of the bar at the head&mdash;it was all under
water now.</p>
<p>It didn't take me long to get there. &nbsp;I shot past the head
at a ripping rate, the current was so swift, and then I got into
the dead water and landed on the side towards the Illinois shore.
&nbsp;I run the canoe into a deep dent in the bank that I knowed
about; I had to part the willow branches to get in; and when I made
fast nobody could a seen the canoe from the outside.</p>
<p>I went up and set down on a log at the head of the island, and
looked out on the big river and the black driftwood and away over
to the town, three mile away, where there was three or four lights
twinkling. &nbsp;A monstrous big lumber-raft was about a mile up
stream, coming along down, with a lantern in the middle of it.
&nbsp;I watched it come creeping down, and when it was most abreast
of where I stood I heard a man say, "Stern oars, there! heave her
head to stabboard!" &nbsp;I heard that just as plain as if the man
was by my side.</p>
<p>There was a little gray in the sky now; so I stepped into the
woods, and laid down for a nap before breakfast.</p>

CHAPTER VIII.</p>
<p>THE sun was up so high when I waked that I judged it was after
eight o'clock. &nbsp;I laid there in the grass and the cool shade
thinking about things, and feeling rested and ruther comfortable
and satisfied. &nbsp;I could see the sun out at one or two holes,
but mostly it was big trees all about, and gloomy in there amongst
them. &nbsp;There was freckled places on the ground where the light
sifted down through the leaves, and the freckled places swapped
about a little, showing there was a little breeze up there. &nbsp;A
couple of squirrels set on a limb and jabbered at me very
friendly.</p>
<p>I was powerful lazy and comfortable&mdash;didn't want to get up
and cook breakfast. &nbsp;Well, I was dozing off again when I
thinks I hears a deep sound of "boom!" away up the river. &nbsp;I
rouses up, and rests on my elbow and listens; pretty soon I hears
it again. &nbsp;I hopped up, and went and looked out at a hole in
the leaves, and I see a bunch of smoke laying on the water a long
ways up&mdash;about abreast the ferry. &nbsp;And there was the
ferryboat full of people floating along down. &nbsp;I knowed what
was the matter now. &nbsp;"Boom!" I see the white smoke squirt out
of the ferryboat's side. &nbsp;You see, they was firing cannon over
the water, trying to make my carcass come to the top.</p>
<p>I was pretty hungry, but it warn't going to do for me to start a
fire, because they might see the smoke. &nbsp;So I set there and
watched the cannon-smoke and listened to the boom. &nbsp;The river
was a mile wide there, and it always looks pretty on a summer
morning&mdash;so I was having a good enough time seeing them hunt
for my remainders if I only had a bite to eat. Well, then I
happened to think how they always put quicksilver in loaves of
bread and float them off, because they always go right to the
drownded carcass and stop there. &nbsp;So, says I, I'll keep a
lookout, and if any of them's floating around after me I'll give
them a show. &nbsp;I changed to the Illinois edge of the island to
see what luck I could have, and I warn't disappointed. &nbsp;A big
double loaf come along, and I most got it with a long stick, but my
foot slipped and she floated out further. &nbsp;Of course I was
where the current set in the closest to the shore&mdash;I knowed
enough for that. &nbsp;But by and by along comes another one, and
this time I won. &nbsp;I took out the plug and shook out the little
dab of quicksilver, and set my teeth in. &nbsp;It was "baker's
bread"&mdash;what the quality eat; none of your low-down
corn-pone.</p>
<p>I got a good place amongst the leaves, and set there on a log,
munching the bread and watching the ferry-boat, and very well
satisfied. &nbsp;And then something struck me. &nbsp;I says, now I
reckon the widow or the parson or somebody prayed that this bread
would find me, and here it has gone and done it. &nbsp;So there
ain't no doubt but there is something in that thing&mdash;that is,
there's something in it when a body like the widow or the parson
prays, but it don't work for me, and I reckon it don't work for
only just the right kind.</p>
<br />
<br />
<a name="c08-63" id="c08-63"></a><br />
<br />
<img alt="c08-63.jpg (79K)" src="images/c08-63.jpg" height="616"
width="459" /><br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<p>I lit a pipe and had a good long smoke, and went on watching.
&nbsp;The ferryboat was floating with the current, and I allowed
I'd have a chance to see who was aboard when she come along,
because she would come in close, where the bread did. &nbsp;When
she'd got pretty well along down towards me, I put out my pipe and
went to where I fished out the bread, and laid down behind a log on
the bank in a little open place. &nbsp;Where the log forked I could
peep through.</p>
<p>By and by she come along, and she drifted in so close that they
could a run out a plank and walked ashore. &nbsp;Most everybody was
on the boat. &nbsp;Pap, and Judge Thatcher, and Bessie Thatcher,
and Jo Harper, and Tom Sawyer, and his old Aunt Polly, and Sid and
Mary, and plenty more. &nbsp;Everybody was talking about the
murder, but the captain broke in and says:</p>
<p>"Look sharp, now; the current sets in the closest here, and
maybe he's washed ashore and got tangled amongst the brush at the
water's edge. &nbsp;I hope so, anyway."</p>
<p>I didn't hope so. &nbsp;They all crowded up and leaned over the
rails, nearly in my face, and kept still, watching with all their
might. &nbsp;I could see them first-rate, but they couldn't see me.
&nbsp;Then the captain sung out:</p>
<p>"Stand away!" and the cannon let off such a blast right before
me that it made me deef with the noise and pretty near blind with
the smoke, and I judged I was gone. &nbsp;If they'd a had some
bullets in, I reckon they'd a got the corpse they was after.
&nbsp;Well, I see I warn't hurt, thanks to goodness. The boat
floated on and went out of sight around the shoulder of the island.
&nbsp;I could hear the booming now and then, further and further
off, and by and by, after an hour, I didn't hear it no more.
&nbsp;The island was three mile long. &nbsp;I judged they had got
to the foot, and was giving it up. &nbsp;But they didn't yet a
while. &nbsp;They turned around the foot of the island and started
up the channel on the Missouri side, under steam, and booming once
in a while as they went. &nbsp;I crossed over to that side and
watched them. When they got abreast the head of the island they
quit shooting and dropped over to the Missouri shore and went home
to the town.</p>
<p>I knowed I was all right now. &nbsp;Nobody else would come
a-hunting after me. I got my traps out of the canoe and made me a
nice camp in the thick woods. &nbsp;I made a kind of a tent out of
my blankets to put my things under so the rain couldn't get at
them. &nbsp;I catched a catfish and haggled him open with my saw,
and towards sundown I started my camp fire and had supper.
&nbsp;Then I set out a line to catch some fish for breakfast.</p>
<p>When it was dark I set by my camp fire smoking, and feeling
pretty well satisfied; but by and by it got sort of lonesome, and
so I went and set on the bank and listened to the current swashing
along, and counted the stars and drift logs and rafts that come
down, and then went to bed; there ain't no better way to put in
time when you are lonesome; you can't stay so, you soon get over
it.</p>
<p>And so for three days and nights. &nbsp;No difference&mdash;just
the same thing. But the next day I went exploring around down
through the island. &nbsp;I was boss of it; it all belonged to me,
so to say, and I wanted to know all about it; but mainly I wanted
to put in the time. &nbsp;I found plenty strawberries, ripe and
prime; and green summer grapes, and green razberries; and the green
blackberries was just beginning to show. &nbsp;They would all come
handy by and by, I judged.</p>
<p>Well, I went fooling along in the deep woods till I judged I
warn't far from the foot of the island. &nbsp;I had my gun along,
but I hadn't shot nothing; it was for protection; thought I would
kill some game nigh home. About this time I mighty near stepped on
a good-sized snake, and it went sliding off through the grass and
flowers, and I after it, trying to get a shot at it. I clipped
along, and all of a sudden I bounded right on to the ashes of a
camp fire that was still smoking.</p>
<br />
<br />
<a name="c08-64" id="c08-64"></a><br />
<br />
<img alt="c08-64.jpg (65K)" src="images/c08-64.jpg" height="586"
width="423" /><br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<p>My heart jumped up amongst my lungs. &nbsp;I never waited for to
look further, but uncocked my gun and went sneaking back on my
tiptoes as fast as ever I could. &nbsp;Every now and then I stopped
a second amongst the thick leaves and listened, but my breath come
so hard I couldn't hear nothing else. &nbsp;I slunk along another
piece further, then listened again; and so on, and so on. &nbsp;If
I see a stump, I took it for a man; if I trod on a stick and broke
it, it made me feel like a person had cut one of my breaths in two
and I only got half, and the short half, too.</p>
<p>When I got to camp I warn't feeling very brash, there warn't
much sand in my craw; but I says, this ain't no time to be fooling
around. &nbsp;So I got all my traps into my canoe again so as to
have them out of sight, and I put out the fire and scattered the
ashes around to look like an old last year's camp, and then clumb a
tree.</p>
<p>I reckon I was up in the tree two hours; but I didn't see
nothing, I didn't hear nothing&mdash;I only THOUGHT I heard and
seen as much as a thousand things. &nbsp;Well, I couldn't stay up
there forever; so at last I got down, but I kept in the thick woods
and on the lookout all the time. All I could get to eat was berries
and what was left over from breakfast.</p>
<p>By the time it was night I was pretty hungry. &nbsp;So when it
was good and dark I slid out from shore before moonrise and paddled
over to the Illinois bank&mdash;about a quarter of a mile. &nbsp;I
went out in the woods and cooked a supper, and I had about made up
my mind I would stay there all night when I hear a PLUNKETY-PLUNK,
PLUNKETY-PLUNK, and says to myself, horses coming; and next I hear
people's voices. &nbsp;I got everything into the canoe as quick as
I could, and then went creeping through the woods to see what I
could find out. &nbsp;I hadn't got far when I hear a man say:</p>
<p>"We better camp here if we can find a good place; the horses is
about beat out. &nbsp;Let's look around."</p>
<p>I didn't wait, but shoved out and paddled away easy. &nbsp;I
tied up in the old place, and reckoned I would sleep in the
canoe.</p>
<p>I didn't sleep much. &nbsp;I couldn't, somehow, for thinking.
&nbsp;And every time I waked up I thought somebody had me by the
neck. &nbsp;So the sleep didn't do me no good. &nbsp;By and by I
says to myself, I can't live this way; I'm a-going to find out who
it is that's here on the island with me; I'll find it out or bust.
&nbsp;Well, I felt better right off.</p>
<p>So I took my paddle and slid out from shore just a step or two,
and then let the canoe drop along down amongst the shadows.
&nbsp;The moon was shining, and outside of the shadows it made it
most as light as day. &nbsp;I poked along well on to an hour,
everything still as rocks and sound asleep. Well, by this time I
was most down to the foot of the island. &nbsp;A little ripply,
cool breeze begun to blow, and that was as good as saying the night
was about done. &nbsp;I give her a turn with the paddle and brung
her nose to shore; then I got my gun and slipped out and into the
edge of the woods. &nbsp;I sat down there on a log, and looked out
through the leaves. &nbsp;I see the moon go off watch, and the
darkness begin to blanket the river. But in a little while I see a
pale streak over the treetops, and knowed the day was coming.
&nbsp;So I took my gun and slipped off towards where I had run
across that camp fire, stopping every minute or two to listen.
&nbsp;But I hadn't no luck somehow; I couldn't seem to find the
place. &nbsp;But by and by, sure enough, I catched a glimpse of
fire away through the trees. &nbsp;I went for it, cautious and
slow. &nbsp;By and by I was close enough to have a look, and there
laid a man on the ground. &nbsp;It most give me the fan-tods. He
had a blanket around his head, and his head was nearly in the fire.
&nbsp;I set there behind a clump of bushes, in about six foot of
him, and kept my eyes on him steady. &nbsp;It was getting gray
daylight now. &nbsp;Pretty soon he gapped and stretched himself and
hove off the blanket, and it was Miss Watson's Jim! &nbsp;I bet I
was glad to see him. &nbsp;I says:</p>
<p>"Hello, Jim!" and skipped out.</p>
<p>He bounced up and stared at me wild. &nbsp;Then he drops down on
his knees, and puts his hands together and says:</p>
<p>"Doan' hurt me&mdash;don't! &nbsp;I hain't ever done no harm to
a ghos'. &nbsp;I alwuz liked dead people, en done all I could for
'em. &nbsp;You go en git in de river agin, whah you b'longs, en
doan' do nuffn to Ole Jim, 'at 'uz awluz yo' fren'."</p>
<br />
<br />
<a name="c08-67" id="c08-67"></a><br />
<br />
<img alt="c08-67.jpg (68K)" src="images/c08-67.jpg" height="470"
width="610" /><br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<p>Well, I warn't long making him understand I warn't dead. &nbsp;I
was ever so glad to see Jim. &nbsp;I warn't lonesome now. &nbsp;I
told him I warn't afraid of HIM telling the people where I was.
&nbsp;I talked along, but he only set there and looked at me; never
said nothing. &nbsp;Then I says:</p>
<p>"It's good daylight. &nbsp;Le's get breakfast. &nbsp;Make up
your camp fire good."</p>
<p>"What's de use er makin' up de camp fire to cook strawbries en
sich truck? But you got a gun, hain't you? &nbsp;Den we kin git
sumfn better den strawbries."</p>
<p>"Strawberries and such truck," I says. &nbsp;"Is that what you
live on?"</p>
<p>"I couldn' git nuffn else," he says.</p>
<p>"Why, how long you been on the island, Jim?"</p>
<p>"I come heah de night arter you's killed."</p>
<p>"What, all that time?"</p>
<p>"Yes&mdash;indeedy."</p>
<p>"And ain't you had nothing but that kind of rubbage to eat?"</p>
<p>"No, sah&mdash;nuffn else."</p>
<p>"Well, you must be most starved, ain't you?"</p>
<p>"I reck'n I could eat a hoss. &nbsp;I think I could. How long
you ben on de islan'?"</p>
<p>"Since the night I got killed."</p>
<p>"No! &nbsp;W'y, what has you lived on? &nbsp;But you got a gun.
&nbsp;Oh, yes, you got a gun. &nbsp;Dat's good. &nbsp;Now you kill
sumfn en I'll make up de fire."</p>
<p>So we went over to where the canoe was, and while he built a
fire in a grassy open place amongst the trees, I fetched meal and
bacon and coffee, and coffee-pot and frying-pan, and sugar and tin
cups, and the nigger was set back considerable, because he reckoned
it was all done with witchcraft. I catched a good big catfish, too,
and Jim cleaned him with his knife, and fried him.</p>
<p>When breakfast was ready we lolled on the grass and eat it
smoking hot. Jim laid it in with all his might, for he was most
about starved. &nbsp;Then when we had got pretty well stuffed, we
laid off and lazied. &nbsp;By and by Jim says:</p>
<p>"But looky here, Huck, who wuz it dat 'uz killed in dat shanty
ef it warn't you?"</p>
<p>Then I told him the whole thing, and he said it was smart.
&nbsp;He said Tom Sawyer couldn't get up no better plan than what I
had. &nbsp;Then I says:</p>
<p>"How do you come to be here, Jim, and how'd you get here?"</p>
<p>He looked pretty uneasy, and didn't say nothing for a minute.
&nbsp;Then he says:</p>
<p>"Maybe I better not tell."</p>
<p>"Why, Jim?"</p>
<p>"Well, dey's reasons. &nbsp;But you wouldn' tell on me ef I uz
to tell you, would you, Huck?"</p>
<p>"Blamed if I would, Jim."</p>
<p>"Well, I b'lieve you, Huck. &nbsp;I&mdash;I RUN OFF."</p>
<p>"Jim!"</p>
<p>"But mind, you said you wouldn' tell&mdash;you know you said you
wouldn' tell, Huck."</p>
<p>"Well, I did. &nbsp;I said I wouldn't, and I'll stick to it.
&nbsp;Honest INJUN, I will. &nbsp;People would call me a low-down
Abolitionist and despise me for keeping mum&mdash;but that don't
make no difference. &nbsp;I ain't a-going to tell, and I ain't
a-going back there, anyways. &nbsp;So, now, le's know all about
it."</p>
<p>"Well, you see, it 'uz dis way. &nbsp;Ole missus&mdash;dat's
Miss Watson&mdash;she pecks on me all de time, en treats me pooty
rough, but she awluz said she wouldn' sell me down to Orleans.
&nbsp;But I noticed dey wuz a nigger trader roun' de place
considable lately, en I begin to git oneasy. &nbsp;Well, one night
I creeps to de do' pooty late, en de do' warn't quite shet, en I
hear old missus tell de widder she gwyne to sell me down to
Orleans, but she didn' want to, but she could git eight hund'd
dollars for me, en it 'uz sich a big stack o' money she couldn'
resis'. &nbsp;De widder she try to git her to say she wouldn' do
it, but I never waited to hear de res'. &nbsp;I lit out mighty
quick, I tell you.</p>
<p>"I tuck out en shin down de hill, en 'spec to steal a skift
'long de sho' som'ers 'bove de town, but dey wuz people a-stirring
yit, so I hid in de ole tumble-down cooper-shop on de bank to wait
for everybody to go 'way. Well, I wuz dah all night. &nbsp;Dey wuz
somebody roun' all de time. &nbsp;'Long 'bout six in de mawnin'
skifts begin to go by, en 'bout eight er nine every skift dat went
'long wuz talkin' 'bout how yo' pap come over to de town en say
you's killed. &nbsp;Dese las' skifts wuz full o' ladies en genlmen
a-goin' over for to see de place. &nbsp;Sometimes dey'd pull up at
de sho' en take a res' b'fo' dey started acrost, so by de talk I
got to know all 'bout de killin'. &nbsp;I 'uz powerful sorry you's
killed, Huck, but I ain't no mo' now.</p>
<p>"I laid dah under de shavin's all day. &nbsp;I 'uz hungry, but I
warn't afeard; bekase I knowed ole missus en de widder wuz goin' to
start to de camp-meet'n' right arter breakfas' en be gone all day,
en dey knows I goes off wid de cattle 'bout daylight, so dey
wouldn' 'spec to see me roun' de place, en so dey wouldn' miss me
tell arter dark in de evenin'. De yuther servants wouldn' miss me,
kase dey'd shin out en take holiday soon as de ole folks 'uz out'n
de way.</p>
<p>"Well, when it come dark I tuck out up de river road, en went
'bout two mile er more to whah dey warn't no houses. &nbsp;I'd made
up my mine 'bout what I's agwyne to do. &nbsp;You see, ef I kep' on
tryin' to git away afoot, de dogs 'ud track me; ef I stole a skift
to cross over, dey'd miss dat skift, you see, en dey'd know 'bout
whah I'd lan' on de yuther side, en whah to pick up my track.
&nbsp;So I says, a raff is what I's arter; it doan' MAKE no
track.</p>
<p>"I see a light a-comin' roun' de p'int bymeby, so I wade' in en
shove' a log ahead o' me en swum more'n half way acrost de river,
en got in 'mongst de drift-wood, en kep' my head down low, en
kinder swum agin de current tell de raff come along. &nbsp;Den I
swum to de stern uv it en tuck a-holt. &nbsp;It clouded up en 'uz
pooty dark for a little while. &nbsp;So I clumb up en laid down on
de planks. &nbsp;De men 'uz all 'way yonder in de middle, whah de
lantern wuz. &nbsp;De river wuz a-risin', en dey wuz a good
current; so I reck'n'd 'at by fo' in de mawnin' I'd be twenty-five
mile down de river, en den I'd slip in jis b'fo' daylight en swim
asho', en take to de woods on de Illinois side.</p>
<p>"But I didn' have no luck. &nbsp;When we 'uz mos' down to de
head er de islan' a man begin to come aft wid de lantern, I see it
warn't no use fer to wait, so I slid overboard en struck out fer de
islan'. &nbsp;Well, I had a notion I could lan' mos' anywhers, but
I couldn't&mdash;bank too bluff. &nbsp;I 'uz mos' to de foot er de
islan' b'fo' I found' a good place. &nbsp;I went into de woods en
jedged I wouldn' fool wid raffs no mo', long as dey move de lantern
roun' so. &nbsp;I had my pipe en a plug er dog-leg, en some matches
in my cap, en dey warn't wet, so I 'uz all right."</p>
<p>"And so you ain't had no meat nor bread to eat all this time?
&nbsp;Why didn't you get mud-turkles?"</p>
<p>"How you gwyne to git 'm? &nbsp;You can't slip up on um en grab
um; en how's a body gwyne to hit um wid a rock? &nbsp;How could a
body do it in de night? &nbsp;En I warn't gwyne to show mysef on de
bank in de daytime."</p>
<p>"Well, that's so. &nbsp;You've had to keep in the woods all the
time, of course. Did you hear 'em shooting the cannon?"</p>
<p>"Oh, yes. &nbsp;I knowed dey was arter you. &nbsp;I see um go by
heah&mdash;watched um thoo de bushes."</p>
<p>Some young birds come along, flying a yard or two at a time and
lighting. Jim said it was a sign it was going to rain. &nbsp;He
said it was a sign when young chickens flew that way, and so he
reckoned it was the same way when young birds done it. &nbsp;I was
going to catch some of them, but Jim wouldn't let me. &nbsp;He said
it was death. &nbsp;He said his father laid mighty sick once, and
some of them catched a bird, and his old granny said his father
would die, and he did.</p>
<p>And Jim said you mustn't count the things you are going to cook
for dinner, because that would bring bad luck. &nbsp;The same if
you shook the table-cloth after sundown. &nbsp;And he said if a man
owned a beehive and that man died, the bees must be told about it
before sun-up next morning, or else the bees would all weaken down
and quit work and die. &nbsp;Jim said bees wouldn't sting idiots;
but I didn't believe that, because I had tried them lots of times
myself, and they wouldn't sting me.</p>
<p>I had heard about some of these things before, but not all of
them. &nbsp;Jim knowed all kinds of signs. &nbsp;He said he knowed
most everything. &nbsp;I said it looked to me like all the signs
was about bad luck, and so I asked him if there warn't any
good-luck signs. &nbsp;He says:</p>
<p>"Mighty few&mdash;an' DEY ain't no use to a body. &nbsp;What you
want to know when good luck's a-comin' for? &nbsp;Want to keep it
off?" &nbsp;And he said: &nbsp;"Ef you's got hairy arms en a hairy
breas', it's a sign dat you's agwyne to be rich. Well, dey's some
use in a sign like dat, 'kase it's so fur ahead. You see, maybe
you's got to be po' a long time fust, en so you might git
discourage' en kill yo'sef 'f you didn' know by de sign dat you
gwyne to be rich bymeby."</p>
<p>"Have you got hairy arms and a hairy breast, Jim?"</p>
<p>"What's de use to ax dat question? &nbsp;Don't you see I
has?"</p>
<p>"Well, are you rich?"</p>
<p>"No, but I ben rich wunst, and gwyne to be rich agin.
&nbsp;Wunst I had foteen dollars, but I tuck to specalat'n', en got
busted out."</p>
<p>"What did you speculate in, Jim?"</p>
<p>"Well, fust I tackled stock."</p>
<p>"What kind of stock?"</p>
<p>"Why, live stock&mdash;cattle, you know. &nbsp;I put ten dollars
in a cow. &nbsp;But I ain' gwyne to resk no mo' money in stock.
&nbsp;De cow up 'n' died on my han's."</p>
<p>"So you lost the ten dollars."</p>
<p>"No, I didn't lose it all. &nbsp;I on'y los' 'bout nine of it.
&nbsp;I sole de hide en taller for a dollar en ten cents."</p>
<p>"You had five dollars and ten cents left. &nbsp;Did you
speculate any more?"</p>

<br />
<p>"Yes. &nbsp;You know that one-laigged nigger dat b'longs to old
Misto Bradish? Well, he sot up a bank, en say anybody dat put in a
dollar would git fo' dollars mo' at de en' er de year. &nbsp;Well,
all de niggers went in, but dey didn't have much. &nbsp;I wuz de
on'y one dat had much. &nbsp;So I stuck out for mo' dan fo'
dollars, en I said 'f I didn' git it I'd start a bank mysef. Well,
o' course dat nigger want' to keep me out er de business, bekase he
says dey warn't business 'nough for two banks, so he say I could
put in my five dollars en he pay me thirty-five at de en' er de
year.</p>
<p>"So I done it. &nbsp;Den I reck'n'd I'd inves' de thirty-five
dollars right off en keep things a-movin'. &nbsp;Dey wuz a nigger
name' Bob, dat had ketched a wood-flat, en his marster didn' know
it; en I bought it off'n him en told him to take de thirty-five
dollars when de en' er de year come; but somebody stole de
wood-flat dat night, en nex day de one-laigged nigger say de bank's
busted. &nbsp;So dey didn' none uv us git no money."</p>
<p>"What did you do with the ten cents, Jim?"</p>
<p>"Well, I 'uz gwyne to spen' it, but I had a dream, en de dream
tole me to give it to a nigger name' Balum&mdash;Balum's Ass dey
call him for short; he's one er dem chuckleheads, you know.
&nbsp;But he's lucky, dey say, en I see I warn't lucky. &nbsp;De
dream say let Balum inves' de ten cents en he'd make a raise for
me. &nbsp;Well, Balum he tuck de money, en when he wuz in church he
hear de preacher say dat whoever give to de po' len' to de Lord, en
boun' to git his money back a hund'd times. &nbsp;So Balum he tuck
en give de ten cents to de po', en laid low to see what wuz gwyne
to come of it."</p>
<p>"Well, what did come of it, Jim?"</p>
<p>"Nuffn never come of it. &nbsp;I couldn' manage to k'leck dat
money no way; en Balum he couldn'. &nbsp;I ain' gwyne to len' no
mo' money 'dout I see de security. &nbsp;Boun' to git yo' money
back a hund'd times, de preacher says! Ef I could git de ten CENTS
back, I'd call it squah, en be glad er de chanst."</p>
<p>"Well, it's all right anyway, Jim, long as you're going to be
rich again some time or other."</p>
<p>"Yes; en I's rich now, come to look at it. &nbsp;I owns mysef,
en I's wuth eight hund'd dollars. &nbsp;I wisht I had de money, I
wouldn' want no mo'."</p>

CHAPTER IX.</p>
<p>I WANTED to go and look at a place right about the middle of the
island that I'd found when I was exploring; so we started and soon
got to it, because the island was only three miles long and a
quarter of a mile wide.</p>
<p>This place was a tolerable long, steep hill or ridge about forty
foot high. We had a rough time getting to the top, the sides was so
steep and the bushes so thick. &nbsp;We tramped and clumb around
all over it, and by and by found a good big cavern in the rock,
most up to the top on the side towards Illinois. &nbsp;The cavern
was as big as two or three rooms bunched together, and Jim could
stand up straight in it. &nbsp;It was cool in there. Jim was for
putting our traps in there right away, but I said we didn't want to
be climbing up and down there all the time.</p>
<p>Jim said if we had the canoe hid in a good place, and had all
the traps in the cavern, we could rush there if anybody was to come
to the island, and they would never find us without dogs.
&nbsp;And, besides, he said them little birds had said it was going
to rain, and did I want the things to get wet?</p>
<p>So we went back and got the canoe, and paddled up abreast the
cavern, and lugged all the traps up there. &nbsp;Then we hunted up
a place close by to hide the canoe in, amongst the thick willows.
&nbsp;We took some fish off of the lines and set them again, and
begun to get ready for dinner.</p>
<p>The door of the cavern was big enough to roll a hogshead in, and
on one side of the door the floor stuck out a little bit, and was
flat and a good place to build a fire on. &nbsp;So we built it
there and cooked dinner.</p>
<br />
<br />
<a name="c09-75" id="c09-75"></a><br />
<br />
<img alt="c09-75.jpg (59K)" src="images/c09-75.jpg" height="459"
width="569" /><br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<p>We spread the blankets inside for a carpet, and eat our dinner
in there. We put all the other things handy at the back of the
cavern. &nbsp;Pretty soon it darkened up, and begun to thunder and
lighten; so the birds was right about it. &nbsp;Directly it begun
to rain, and it rained like all fury, too, and I never see the wind
blow so. &nbsp;It was one of these regular summer storms. &nbsp;It
would get so dark that it looked all blue-black outside, and
lovely; and the rain would thrash along by so thick that the trees
off a little ways looked dim and spider-webby; and here would come
a blast of wind that would bend the trees down and turn up the pale
underside of the leaves; and then a perfect ripper of a gust would
follow along and set the branches to tossing their arms as if they
was just wild; and next, when it was just about the bluest and
blackest&mdash;FST! it was as bright as glory, and you'd have a
little glimpse of tree-tops a-plunging about away off yonder in the
storm, hundreds of yards further than you could see before; dark as
sin again in a second, and now you'd hear the thunder let go with
an awful crash, and then go rumbling, grumbling, tumbling, down the
sky towards the under side of the world, like rolling empty barrels
down stairs&mdash;where it's long stairs and they bounce a good
deal, you know.</p>
<p>"Jim, this is nice," I says. &nbsp;"I wouldn't want to be
nowhere else but here. Pass me along another hunk of fish and some
hot corn-bread."</p>
<p>"Well, you wouldn't a ben here 'f it hadn't a ben for Jim.
&nbsp;You'd a ben down dah in de woods widout any dinner, en gittn'
mos' drownded, too; dat you would, honey. &nbsp;Chickens knows when
it's gwyne to rain, en so do de birds, chile."</p>
<p>The river went on raising and raising for ten or twelve days,
till at last it was over the banks. &nbsp;The water was three or
four foot deep on the island in the low places and on the Illinois
bottom. &nbsp;On that side it was a good many miles wide, but on
the Missouri side it was the same old distance across&mdash;a half
a mile&mdash;because the Missouri shore was just a wall of high
bluffs.</p>
<p>Daytimes we paddled all over the island in the canoe, It was
mighty cool and shady in the deep woods, even if the sun was
blazing outside. &nbsp;We went winding in and out amongst the
trees, and sometimes the vines hung so thick we had to back away
and go some other way. &nbsp;Well, on every old broken-down tree
you could see rabbits and snakes and such things; and when the
island had been overflowed a day or two they got so tame, on
account of being hungry, that you could paddle right up and put
your hand on them if you wanted to; but not the snakes and
turtles&mdash;they would slide off in the water. &nbsp;The ridge
our cavern was in was full of them. We could a had pets enough if
we'd wanted them.</p>
<p>One night we catched a little section of a lumber
raft&mdash;nice pine planks. It was twelve foot wide and about
fifteen or sixteen foot long, and the top stood above water six or
seven inches&mdash;a solid, level floor. &nbsp;We could see
saw-logs go by in the daylight sometimes, but we let them go; we
didn't show ourselves in daylight.</p>
<p>Another night when we was up at the head of the island, just
before daylight, here comes a frame-house down, on the west side.
&nbsp;She was a two-story, and tilted over considerable. &nbsp;We
paddled out and got aboard&mdash;clumb in at an upstairs window.
&nbsp;But it was too dark to see yet, so we made the canoe fast and
set in her to wait for daylight.</p>
<p>The light begun to come before we got to the foot of the island.
&nbsp;Then we looked in at the window. &nbsp;We could make out a
bed, and a table, and two old chairs, and lots of things around
about on the floor, and there was clothes hanging against the wall.
&nbsp;There was something laying on the floor in the far corner
that looked like a man. &nbsp;So Jim says:</p>
<p>"Hello, you!"</p>
<p>But it didn't budge. &nbsp;So I hollered again, and then Jim
says:</p>
<p>"De man ain't asleep&mdash;he's dead. &nbsp;You hold
still&mdash;I'll go en see."</p>
<p>He went, and bent down and looked, and says:</p>
<p>"It's a dead man. &nbsp;Yes, indeedy; naked, too. &nbsp;He's ben
shot in de back. I reck'n he's ben dead two er three days.
&nbsp;Come in, Huck, but doan' look at his face&mdash;it's too
gashly."</p>

width="607" /><br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<p>I didn't look at him at all. &nbsp;Jim throwed some old rags
over him, but he needn't done it; I didn't want to see him.
&nbsp;There was heaps of old greasy cards scattered around over the
floor, and old whisky bottles, and a couple of masks made out of
black cloth; and all over the walls was the ignorantest kind of
words and pictures made with charcoal. &nbsp;There was two old
dirty calico dresses, and a sun-bonnet, and some women's
underclothes hanging against the wall, and some men's clothing,
too. &nbsp;We put the lot into the canoe&mdash;it might come good.
&nbsp;There was a boy's old speckled straw hat on the floor; I took
that, too. &nbsp;And there was a bottle that had had milk in it,
and it had a rag stopper for a baby to suck. &nbsp;We would a took
the bottle, but it was broke. &nbsp;There was a seedy old chest,
and an old hair trunk with the hinges broke. &nbsp;They stood open,
but there warn't nothing left in them that was any account.
&nbsp;The way things was scattered about we reckoned the people
left in a hurry, and warn't fixed so as to carry off most of their
stuff.</p>
<p>We got an old tin lantern, and a butcher-knife without any
handle, and a bran-new Barlow knife worth two bits in any store,
and a lot of tallow candles, and a tin candlestick, and a gourd,
and a tin cup, and a ratty old bedquilt off the bed, and a reticule
with needles and pins and beeswax and buttons and thread and all
such truck in it, and a hatchet and some nails, and a fishline as
thick as my little finger with some monstrous hooks on it, and a
roll of buckskin, and a leather dog-collar, and a horseshoe, and
some vials of medicine that didn't have no label on them; and just
as we was leaving I found a tolerable good curry-comb, and Jim he
found a ratty old fiddle-bow, and a wooden leg. &nbsp;The straps
was broke off of it, but, barring that, it was a good enough leg,
though it was too long for me and not long enough for Jim, and we
couldn't find the other one, though we hunted all around.</p>
<p>And so, take it all around, we made a good haul. &nbsp;When we
was ready to shove off we was a quarter of a mile below the island,
and it was pretty broad day; so I made Jim lay down in the canoe
and cover up with the quilt, because if he set up people could tell
he was a nigger a good ways off. &nbsp;I paddled over to the
Illinois shore, and drifted down most a half a mile doing it.
&nbsp;I crept up the dead water under the bank, and hadn't no
accidents and didn't see nobody. &nbsp;We got home all safe.</p>

CHAPTER X.</p>
<p>AFTER breakfast I wanted to talk about the dead man and guess
out how he come to be killed, but Jim didn't want to. &nbsp;He said
it would fetch bad luck; and besides, he said, he might come and
ha'nt us; he said a man that warn't buried was more likely to go
a-ha'nting around than one that was planted and comfortable.
&nbsp;That sounded pretty reasonable, so I didn't say no more; but
I couldn't keep from studying over it and wishing I knowed who shot
the man, and what they done it for.</p>
<p>We rummaged the clothes we'd got, and found eight dollars in
silver sewed up in the lining of an old blanket overcoat. &nbsp;Jim
said he reckoned the people in that house stole the coat, because
if they'd a knowed the money was there they wouldn't a left it.
&nbsp;I said I reckoned they killed him, too; but Jim didn't want
to talk about that. &nbsp;I says:</p>
<p>"Now you think it's bad luck; but what did you say when I
fetched in the snake-skin that I found on the top of the ridge day
before yesterday? You said it was the worst bad luck in the world
to touch a snake-skin with my hands. &nbsp;Well, here's your bad
luck! &nbsp;We've raked in all this truck and eight dollars
besides. &nbsp;I wish we could have some bad luck like this every
day, Jim."</p>
<p>"Never you mind, honey, never you mind. &nbsp;Don't you git too
peart. &nbsp;It's a-comin'. &nbsp;Mind I tell you, it's
a-comin'."</p>
<p>It did come, too. &nbsp;It was a Tuesday that we had that talk.
&nbsp;Well, after dinner Friday we was laying around in the grass
at the upper end of the ridge, and got out of tobacco. &nbsp;I went
to the cavern to get some, and found a rattlesnake in there.
&nbsp;I killed him, and curled him up on the foot of Jim's blanket,
ever so natural, thinking there'd be some fun when Jim found him
there. &nbsp;Well, by night I forgot all about the snake, and when
Jim flung himself down on the blanket while I struck a light the
snake's mate was there, and bit him.</p>
<p>He jumped up yelling, and the first thing the light showed was
the varmint curled up and ready for another spring. &nbsp;I laid
him out in a second with a stick, and Jim grabbed pap's whisky-jug
and begun to pour it down.</p>
<br />
<br />
<a name="c10-80" id="c10-80"></a><br />
<br />
<img alt="c10-80.jpg (66K)" src="images/c10-80.jpg" height="658"
width="457" /><br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<p>He was barefooted, and the snake bit him right on the heel.
&nbsp;That all comes of my being such a fool as to not remember
that wherever you leave a dead snake its mate always comes there
and curls around it. &nbsp;Jim told me to chop off the snake's head
and throw it away, and then skin the body and roast a piece of it.
&nbsp;I done it, and he eat it and said it would help cure him. He
made me take off the rattles and tie them around his wrist, too.
&nbsp;He said that that would help. &nbsp;Then I slid out quiet and
throwed the snakes clear away amongst the bushes; for I warn't
going to let Jim find out it was all my fault, not if I could help
it.</p>
<p>Jim sucked and sucked at the jug, and now and then he got out of
his head and pitched around and yelled; but every time he come to
himself he went to sucking at the jug again. &nbsp;His foot swelled
up pretty big, and so did his leg; but by and by the drunk begun to
come, and so I judged he was all right; but I'd druther been bit
with a snake than pap's whisky.</p>
<p>Jim was laid up for four days and nights. &nbsp;Then the
swelling was all gone and he was around again. &nbsp;I made up my
mind I wouldn't ever take a-holt of a snake-skin again with my
hands, now that I see what had come of it. Jim said he reckoned I
would believe him next time. &nbsp;And he said that handling a
snake-skin was such awful bad luck that maybe we hadn't got to the
end of it yet. &nbsp;He said he druther see the new moon over his
left shoulder as much as a thousand times than take up a snake-skin
in his hand. &nbsp;Well, I was getting to feel that way myself,
though I've always reckoned that looking at the new moon over your
left shoulder is one of the carelessest and foolishest things a
body can do. &nbsp;Old Hank Bunker done it once, and bragged about
it; and in less than two years he got drunk and fell off of the
shot-tower, and spread himself out so that he was just a kind of a
layer, as you may say; and they slid him edgeways between two barn
doors for a coffin, and buried him so, so they say, but I didn't
see it. &nbsp;Pap told me. &nbsp;But anyway it all come of looking
at the moon that way, like a fool.</p>

<p>Well, the days went along, and the river went down between its
banks again; and about the first thing we done was to bait one of
the big hooks with a skinned rabbit and set it and catch a catfish
that was as big as a man, being six foot two inches long, and
weighed over two hundred pounds. We couldn't handle him, of course;
he would a flung us into Illinois. &nbsp;We just set there and
watched him rip and tear around till he drownded. &nbsp;We found a
brass button in his stomach and a round ball, and lots of rubbage.
&nbsp;We split the ball open with the hatchet, and there was a
spool in it. &nbsp;Jim said he'd had it there a long time, to coat
it over so and make a ball of it. &nbsp;It was as big a fish as was
ever catched in the Mississippi, I reckon. &nbsp;Jim said he hadn't
ever seen a bigger one. &nbsp;He would a been worth a good deal
over at the village. &nbsp;They peddle out such a fish as that by
the pound in the market-house there; everybody buys some of him;
his meat's as white as snow and makes a good fry.</p>
<p>Next morning I said it was getting slow and dull, and I wanted
to get a stirring up some way. &nbsp;I said I reckoned I would slip
over the river and find out what was going on. &nbsp;Jim liked that
notion; but he said I must go in the dark and look sharp.
&nbsp;Then he studied it over and said, couldn't I put on some of
them old things and dress up like a girl? &nbsp;That was a good
notion, too. &nbsp;So we shortened up one of the calico gowns, and
I turned up my trouser-legs to my knees and got into it. &nbsp;Jim
hitched it behind with the hooks, and it was a fair fit. &nbsp;I
put on the sun-bonnet and tied it under my chin, and then for a
body to look in and see my face was like looking down a joint of
stove-pipe. &nbsp;Jim said nobody would know me, even in the
daytime, hardly. &nbsp;I practiced around all day to get the hang
of the things, and by and by I could do pretty well in them, only
Jim said I didn't walk like a girl; and he said I must quit pulling
up my gown to get at my britches-pocket. &nbsp;I took notice, and
done better.</p>

<p>I started up the Illinois shore in the canoe just after
dark.</p>
<p>I started across to the town from a little below the
ferry-landing, and the drift of the current fetched me in at the
bottom of the town. &nbsp;I tied up and started along the bank.
&nbsp;There was a light burning in a little shanty that hadn't been
lived in for a long time, and I wondered who had took up quarters
there. &nbsp;I slipped up and peeped in at the window. &nbsp;There
was a woman about forty year old in there knitting by a candle that
was on a pine table. &nbsp;I didn't know her face; she was a
stranger, for you couldn't start a face in that town that I didn't
know. &nbsp;Now this was lucky, because I was weakening; I was
getting afraid I had come; people might know my voice and find me
out. &nbsp;But if this woman had been in such a little town two
days she could tell me all I wanted to know; so I knocked at the
door, and made up my mind I wouldn't forget I was a girl.</p>

CHAPTER XI.</p>
<p>"COME in," says the woman, and I did. &nbsp;She says:
&nbsp;"Take a cheer."</p>
<p>I done it. &nbsp;She looked me all over with her little shiny
eyes, and says:</p>
<p>"What might your name be?"</p>
<p>"Sarah Williams."</p>
<p>"Where 'bouts do you live? &nbsp;In this neighborhood?'</p>
<p>"No'm. &nbsp;In Hookerville, seven mile below. &nbsp;I've walked
all the way and I'm all tired out."</p>
<p>"Hungry, too, I reckon. &nbsp;I'll find you something."</p>
<p>"No'm, I ain't hungry. &nbsp;I was so hungry I had to stop two
miles below here at a farm; so I ain't hungry no more. &nbsp;It's
what makes me so late. My mother's down sick, and out of money and
everything, and I come to tell my uncle Abner Moore. &nbsp;He lives
at the upper end of the town, she says. &nbsp;I hain't ever been
here before. &nbsp;Do you know him?"</p>
<p>"No; but I don't know everybody yet. &nbsp;I haven't lived here
quite two weeks. It's a considerable ways to the upper end of the
town. &nbsp;You better stay here all night. &nbsp;Take off your
bonnet."</p>
<p>"No," I says; "I'll rest a while, I reckon, and go on. &nbsp;I
ain't afeared of the dark."</p>
<p>She said she wouldn't let me go by myself, but her husband would
be in by and by, maybe in a hour and a half, and she'd send him
along with me. Then she got to talking about her husband, and about
her relations up the river, and her relations down the river, and
about how much better off they used to was, and how they didn't
know but they'd made a mistake coming to our town, instead of
letting well alone&mdash;and so on and so on, till I was afeard I
had made a mistake coming to her to find out what was going on in
the town; but by and by she dropped on to pap and the murder, and
then I was pretty willing to let her clatter right along. &nbsp;She
told about me and Tom Sawyer finding the six thousand dollars (only
she got it ten) and all about pap and what a hard lot he was, and
what a hard lot I was, and at last she got down to where I was
murdered. &nbsp;I says:</p>
<p>"Who done it? &nbsp;We've heard considerable about these goings
on down in Hookerville, but we don't know who 'twas that killed
Huck Finn."</p>
<p>"Well, I reckon there's a right smart chance of people HERE
that'd like to know who killed him. &nbsp;Some think old Finn done
it himself."</p>
<p>"No&mdash;is that so?"</p>
<p>"Most everybody thought it at first. &nbsp;He'll never know how
nigh he come to getting lynched. &nbsp;But before night they
changed around and judged it was done by a runaway nigger named
Jim."</p>
<p>"Why HE&mdash;"</p>
<p>I stopped. &nbsp;I reckoned I better keep still. &nbsp;She run
on, and never noticed I had put in at all:</p>
<p>"The nigger run off the very night Huck Finn was killed.
&nbsp;So there's a reward out for him&mdash;three hundred dollars.
&nbsp;And there's a reward out for old Finn, too&mdash;two hundred
dollars. &nbsp;You see, he come to town the morning after the
murder, and told about it, and was out with 'em on the ferryboat
hunt, and right away after he up and left. &nbsp;Before night they
wanted to lynch him, but he was gone, you see. &nbsp;Well, next day
they found out the nigger was gone; they found out he hadn't ben
seen sence ten o'clock the night the murder was done. &nbsp;So then
they put it on him, you see; and while they was full of it, next
day, back comes old Finn, and went boo-hooing to Judge Thatcher to
get money to hunt for the nigger all over Illinois with. The judge
gave him some, and that evening he got drunk, and was around till
after midnight with a couple of mighty hard-looking strangers, and
then went off with them. &nbsp;Well, he hain't come back sence, and
they ain't looking for him back till this thing blows over a
little, for people thinks now that he killed his boy and fixed
things so folks would think robbers done it, and then he'd get
Huck's money without having to bother a long time with a lawsuit.
&nbsp;People do say he warn't any too good to do it. &nbsp;Oh, he's
sly, I reckon. &nbsp;If he don't come back for a year he'll be all
right. &nbsp;You can't prove anything on him, you know; everything
will be quieted down then, and he'll walk in Huck's money as easy
as nothing."</p>
<p>"Yes, I reckon so, 'm. &nbsp;I don't see nothing in the way of
it. &nbsp;Has everybody guit thinking the nigger done it?"</p>
<p>"Oh, no, not everybody. &nbsp;A good many thinks he done it.
&nbsp;But they'll get the nigger pretty soon now, and maybe they
can scare it out of him."</p>
<p>"Why, are they after him yet?"</p>
<p>"Well, you're innocent, ain't you! &nbsp;Does three hundred
dollars lay around every day for people to pick up? &nbsp;Some
folks think the nigger ain't far from here. &nbsp;I'm one of
them&mdash;but I hain't talked it around. &nbsp;A few days ago I
was talking with an old couple that lives next door in the log
shanty, and they happened to say hardly anybody ever goes to that
island over yonder that they call Jackson's Island. &nbsp;Don't
anybody live there? says I. No, nobody, says they. &nbsp;I didn't
say any more, but I done some thinking. &nbsp;I was pretty near
certain I'd seen smoke over there, about the head of the island, a
day or two before that, so I says to myself, like as not that
nigger's hiding over there; anyway, says I, it's worth the trouble
to give the place a hunt. &nbsp;I hain't seen any smoke sence, so I
reckon maybe he's gone, if it was him; but husband's going over to
see&mdash;him and another man. &nbsp;He was gone up the river; but
he got back to-day, and I told him as soon as he got here two hours
ago."</p>

<br />
<p>I had got so uneasy I couldn't set still. &nbsp;I had to do
something with my hands; so I took up a needle off of the table and
went to threading it. My hands shook, and I was making a bad job of
it. &nbsp;When the woman stopped talking I looked up, and she was
looking at me pretty curious and smiling a little. &nbsp;I put down
the needle and thread, and let on to be interested&mdash;and I was,
too&mdash;and says:</p>
<p>"Three hundred dollars is a power of money. &nbsp;I wish my
mother could get it. Is your husband going over there
to-night?"</p>
<p>"Oh, yes. &nbsp;He went up-town with the man I was telling you
of, to get a boat and see if they could borrow another gun.
&nbsp;They'll go over after midnight."</p>
<p>"Couldn't they see better if they was to wait till daytime?"</p>
<p>"Yes. &nbsp;And couldn't the nigger see better, too? &nbsp;After
midnight he'll likely be asleep, and they can slip around through
the woods and hunt up his camp fire all the better for the dark, if
he's got one."</p>
<p>"I didn't think of that."</p>
<p>The woman kept looking at me pretty curious, and I didn't feel a
bit comfortable. &nbsp;Pretty soon she says,</p>
<p>"What did you say your name was, honey?"</p>
<p>"M&mdash;Mary Williams."</p>
<p>Somehow it didn't seem to me that I said it was Mary before, so
I didn't look up&mdash;seemed to me I said it was Sarah; so I felt
sort of cornered, and was afeared maybe I was looking it, too.
&nbsp;I wished the woman would say something more; the longer she
set still the uneasier I was. &nbsp;But now she says:</p>
<p>"Honey, I thought you said it was Sarah when you first come
in?"</p>
<p>"Oh, yes'm, I did. &nbsp;Sarah Mary Williams. &nbsp;Sarah's my
first name. &nbsp;Some calls me Sarah, some calls me Mary."</p>
<p>"Oh, that's the way of it?"</p>
<p>"Yes'm."</p>
<p>I was feeling better then, but I wished I was out of there,
anyway. &nbsp;I couldn't look up yet.</p>
<p>Well, the woman fell to talking about how hard times was, and
how poor they had to live, and how the rats was as free as if they
owned the place, and so forth and so on, and then I got easy again.
&nbsp;She was right about the rats. You'd see one stick his nose
out of a hole in the corner every little while. &nbsp;She said she
had to have things handy to throw at them when she was alone, or
they wouldn't give her no peace. &nbsp;She showed me a bar of lead
twisted up into a knot, and said she was a good shot with it
generly, but she'd wrenched her arm a day or two ago, and didn't
know whether she could throw true now. &nbsp;But she watched for a
chance, and directly banged away at a rat; but she missed him wide,
and said "Ouch!" it hurt her arm so. &nbsp;Then she told me to try
for the next one. &nbsp;I wanted to be getting away before the old
man got back, but of course I didn't let on. &nbsp;I got the thing,
and the first rat that showed his nose I let drive, and if he'd a
stayed where he was he'd a been a tolerable sick rat. &nbsp;She
said that was first-rate, and she reckoned I would hive the next
one. &nbsp;She went and got the lump of lead and fetched it back,
and brought along a hank of yarn which she wanted me to help her
with. &nbsp;I held up my two hands and she put the hank over them,
and went on talking about her and her husband's matters. &nbsp;But
she broke off to say:</p>
<p>"Keep your eye on the rats. &nbsp;You better have the lead in
your lap, handy."</p>
<p>So she dropped the lump into my lap just at that moment, and I
clapped my legs together on it and she went on talking. &nbsp;But
only about a minute. Then she took off the hank and looked me
straight in the face, and very pleasant, and says:</p>
<p>"Come, now, what's your real name?"</p>
<p>"Wh&mdash;what, mum?"</p>
<p>"What's your real name? &nbsp;Is it Bill, or Tom, or
Bob?&mdash;or what is it?"</p>
<p>I reckon I shook like a leaf, and I didn't know hardly what to
do. &nbsp;But I says:</p>
<p>"Please to don't poke fun at a poor girl like me, mum. &nbsp;If
I'm in the way here, I'll&mdash;"</p>
<p>"No, you won't. &nbsp;Set down and stay where you are. &nbsp;I
ain't going to hurt you, and I ain't going to tell on you, nuther.
&nbsp;You just tell me your secret, and trust me. &nbsp;I'll keep
it; and, what's more, I'll help you. So'll my old man if you want
him to. &nbsp;You see, you're a runaway 'prentice, that's all.
&nbsp;It ain't anything. &nbsp;There ain't no harm in it. You've
been treated bad, and you made up your mind to cut. &nbsp;Bless
you, child, I wouldn't tell on you. &nbsp;Tell me all about it now,
that's a good boy."</p>
<p>So I said it wouldn't be no use to try to play it any longer,
and I would just make a clean breast and tell her everything, but
she musn't go back on her promise. &nbsp;Then I told her my father
and mother was dead, and the law had bound me out to a mean old
farmer in the country thirty mile back from the river, and he
treated me so bad I couldn't stand it no longer; he went away to be
gone a couple of days, and so I took my chance and stole some of
his daughter's old clothes and cleared out, and I had been three
nights coming the thirty miles. &nbsp;I traveled nights, and hid
daytimes and slept, and the bag of bread and meat I carried from
home lasted me all the way, and I had a-plenty. &nbsp;I said I
believed my uncle Abner Moore would take care of me, and so that
was why I struck out for this town of Goshen.</p>
<p>"Goshen, child? &nbsp;This ain't Goshen. &nbsp;This is St.
Petersburg. &nbsp;Goshen's ten mile further up the river. &nbsp;Who
told you this was Goshen?"</p>
<p>"Why, a man I met at daybreak this morning, just as I was going
to turn into the woods for my regular sleep. &nbsp;He told me when
the roads forked I must take the right hand, and five mile would
fetch me to Goshen."</p>
<p>"He was drunk, I reckon. &nbsp;He told you just exactly
wrong."</p>
<p>"Well, he did act like he was drunk, but it ain't no matter now.
&nbsp;I got to be moving along. &nbsp;I'll fetch Goshen before
daylight."</p>
<p>"Hold on a minute. &nbsp;I'll put you up a snack to eat.
&nbsp;You might want it."</p>

width="438" /><br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<p>So she put me up a snack, and says:</p>
<p>"Say, when a cow's laying down, which end of her gets up first?
&nbsp;Answer up prompt now&mdash;don't stop to study over it.
&nbsp;Which end gets up first?"</p>
<p>"The hind end, mum."</p>
<p>"Well, then, a horse?"</p>
<p>"The for'rard end, mum."</p>
<p>"Which side of a tree does the moss grow on?"</p>
<p>"North side."</p>
<p>"If fifteen cows is browsing on a hillside, how many of them
eats with their heads pointed the same direction?"</p>
<p>"The whole fifteen, mum."</p>
<p>"Well, I reckon you HAVE lived in the country. &nbsp;I thought
maybe you was trying to hocus me again. &nbsp;What's your real
name, now?"</p>
<p>"George Peters, mum."</p>
<p>"Well, try to remember it, George. &nbsp;Don't forget and tell
me it's Elexander before you go, and then get out by saying it's
George Elexander when I catch you. &nbsp;And don't go about women
in that old calico. &nbsp;You do a girl tolerable poor, but you
might fool men, maybe. &nbsp;Bless you, child, when you set out to
thread a needle don't hold the thread still and fetch the needle up
to it; hold the needle still and poke the thread at it; that's the
way a woman most always does, but a man always does t'other way.
&nbsp;And when you throw at a rat or anything, hitch yourself up a
tiptoe and fetch your hand up over your head as awkward as you can,
and miss your rat about six or seven foot. Throw stiff-armed from
the shoulder, like there was a pivot there for it to turn on, like
a girl; not from the wrist and elbow, with your arm out to one
side, like a boy. &nbsp;And, mind you, when a girl tries to catch
anything in her lap she throws her knees apart; she don't clap them
together, the way you did when you catched the lump of lead.
&nbsp;Why, I spotted you for a boy when you was threading the
needle; and I contrived the other things just to make certain.
&nbsp;Now trot along to your uncle, Sarah Mary Williams George
Elexander Peters, and if you get into trouble you send word to Mrs.
Judith Loftus, which is me, and I'll do what I can to get you out
of it. &nbsp;Keep the river road all the way, and next time you
tramp take shoes and socks with you. The river road's a rocky one,
and your feet'll be in a condition when you get to Goshen, I
reckon."</p>
<p>I went up the bank about fifty yards, and then I doubled on my
tracks and slipped back to where my canoe was, a good piece below
the house. &nbsp;I jumped in, and was off in a hurry. &nbsp;I went
up-stream far enough to make the head of the island, and then
started across. &nbsp;I took off the sun-bonnet, for I didn't want
no blinders on then. &nbsp;When I was about the middle I heard the
clock begin to strike, so I stops and listens; the sound come faint
over the water but clear&mdash;eleven. &nbsp;When I struck the head
of the island I never waited to blow, though I was most winded, but
I shoved right into the timber where my old camp used to be, and
started a good fire there on a high and dry spot.</p>
<p>Then I jumped in the canoe and dug out for our place, a mile and
a half below, as hard as I could go. &nbsp;I landed, and slopped
through the timber and up the ridge and into the cavern.
&nbsp;There Jim laid, sound asleep on the ground. &nbsp;I roused
him out and says:</p>
<p>"Git up and hump yourself, Jim! &nbsp;There ain't a minute to
lose. &nbsp;They're after us!"</p>

<br />
<br />
<br />
<p>Jim never asked no questions, he never said a word; but the way
he worked for the next half an hour showed about how he was scared.
&nbsp;By that time everything we had in the world was on our raft,
and she was ready to be shoved out from the willow cove where she
was hid. &nbsp;We put out the camp fire at the cavern the first
thing, and didn't show a candle outside after that.</p>
<p>I took the canoe out from the shore a little piece, and took a
look; but if there was a boat around I couldn't see it, for stars
and shadows ain't good to see by. &nbsp;Then we got out the raft
and slipped along down in the shade, past the foot of the island
dead still&mdash;never saying a word.</p>

CHAPTER XII.</p>
<p>IT must a been close on to one o'clock when we got below the
island at last, and the raft did seem to go mighty slow. &nbsp;If a
boat was to come along we was going to take to the canoe and break
for the Illinois shore; and it was well a boat didn't come, for we
hadn't ever thought to put the gun in the canoe, or a fishing-line,
or anything to eat. &nbsp;We was in ruther too much of a sweat to
think of so many things. &nbsp;It warn't good judgment to put
EVERYTHING on the raft.</p>
<p>If the men went to the island I just expect they found the camp
fire I built, and watched it all night for Jim to come.
&nbsp;Anyways, they stayed away from us, and if my building the
fire never fooled them it warn't no fault of mine. &nbsp;I played
it as low down on them as I could.</p>
<p>When the first streak of day began to show we tied up to a
towhead in a big bend on the Illinois side, and hacked off
cottonwood branches with the hatchet, and covered up the raft with
them so she looked like there had been a cave-in in the bank there.
&nbsp;A tow-head is a sandbar that has cottonwoods on it as thick
as harrow-teeth.</p>
<p>We had mountains on the Missouri shore and heavy timber on the
Illinois side, and the channel was down the Missouri shore at that
place, so we warn't afraid of anybody running across us. &nbsp;We
laid there all day, and watched the rafts and steamboats spin down
the Missouri shore, and up-bound steamboats fight the big river in
the middle. &nbsp;I told Jim all about the time I had jabbering
with that woman; and Jim said she was a smart one, and if she was
to start after us herself she wouldn't set down and watch a camp
fire&mdash;no, sir, she'd fetch a dog. &nbsp;Well, then, I said,
why couldn't she tell her husband to fetch a dog? &nbsp;Jim said he
bet she did think of it by the time the men was ready to start, and
he believed they must a gone up-town to get a dog and so they lost
all that time, or else we wouldn't be here on a towhead sixteen or
seventeen mile below the village&mdash;no, indeedy, we would be in
that same old town again. &nbsp;So I said I didn't care what was
the reason they didn't get us as long as they didn't.</p>
<p>When it was beginning to come on dark we poked our heads out of
the cottonwood thicket, and looked up and down and across; nothing
in sight; so Jim took up some of the top planks of the raft and
built a snug wigwam to get under in blazing weather and rainy, and
to keep the things dry. Jim made a floor for the wigwam, and raised
it a foot or more above the level of the raft, so now the blankets
and all the traps was out of reach of steamboat waves. &nbsp;Right
in the middle of the wigwam we made a layer of dirt about five or
six inches deep with a frame around it for to hold it to its place;
this was to build a fire on in sloppy weather or chilly; the wigwam
would keep it from being seen. &nbsp;We made an extra steering-oar,
too, because one of the others might get broke on a snag or
something. We fixed up a short forked stick to hang the old lantern
on, because we must always light the lantern whenever we see a
steamboat coming down-stream, to keep from getting run over; but we
wouldn't have to light it for up-stream boats unless we see we was
in what they call a "crossing"; for the river was pretty high yet,
very low banks being still a little under water; so up-bound boats
didn't always run the channel, but hunted easy water.</p>
<p>This second night we run between seven and eight hours, with a
current that was making over four mile an hour. &nbsp;We catched
fish and talked, and we took a swim now and then to keep off
sleepiness. &nbsp;It was kind of solemn, drifting down the big,
still river, laying on our backs looking up at the stars, and we
didn't ever feel like talking loud, and it warn't often that we
laughed&mdash;only a little kind of a low chuckle. &nbsp;We had
mighty good weather as a general thing, and nothing ever happened
to us at all&mdash;that night, nor the next, nor the next.</p>
<p>Every night we passed towns, some of them away up on black
hillsides, nothing but just a shiny bed of lights; not a house
could you see. &nbsp;The fifth night we passed St. Louis, and it
was like the whole world lit up. In St. Petersburg they used to say
there was twenty or thirty thousand people in St. Louis, but I
never believed it till I see that wonderful spread of lights at two
o'clock that still night. &nbsp;There warn't a sound there;
everybody was asleep.</p>
<p>Every night now I used to slip ashore towards ten o'clock at
some little village, and buy ten or fifteen cents' worth of meal or
bacon or other stuff to eat; and sometimes I lifted a chicken that
warn't roosting comfortable, and took him along. &nbsp;Pap always
said, take a chicken when you get a chance, because if you don't
want him yourself you can easy find somebody that does, and a good
deed ain't ever forgot. &nbsp;I never see pap when he didn't want
the chicken himself, but that is what he used to say, anyway.</p>

<br />
<p>Mornings before daylight I slipped into cornfields and borrowed
a watermelon, or a mushmelon, or a punkin, or some new corn, or
things of that kind. &nbsp;Pap always said it warn't no harm to
borrow things if you was meaning to pay them back some time; but
the widow said it warn't anything but a soft name for stealing, and
no decent body would do it. &nbsp;Jim said he reckoned the widow
was partly right and pap was partly right; so the best way would be
for us to pick out two or three things from the list and say we
wouldn't borrow them any more&mdash;then he reckoned it wouldn't be
no harm to borrow the others. &nbsp;So we talked it over all one
night, drifting along down the river, trying to make up our minds
whether to drop the watermelons, or the cantelopes, or the
mushmelons, or what. &nbsp;But towards daylight we got it all
settled satisfactory, and concluded to drop crabapples and
p'simmons. &nbsp;We warn't feeling just right before that, but it
was all comfortable now. &nbsp;I was glad the way it come out, too,
because crabapples ain't ever good, and the p'simmons wouldn't be
ripe for two or three months yet.</p>
<p>We shot a water-fowl now and then that got up too early in the
morning or didn't go to bed early enough in the evening. &nbsp;Take
it all round, we lived pretty high.</p>
<p>The fifth night below St. Louis we had a big storm after
midnight, with a power of thunder and lightning, and the rain
poured down in a solid sheet. We stayed in the wigwam and let the
raft take care of itself. When the lightning glared out we could
see a big straight river ahead, and high, rocky bluffs on both
sides. &nbsp;By and by says I, "Hel-LO, Jim, looky yonder!" It was
a steamboat that had killed herself on a rock. &nbsp;We was
drifting straight down for her. &nbsp;The lightning showed her very
distinct. &nbsp;She was leaning over, with part of her upper deck
above water, and you could see every little chimbly-guy clean and
clear, and a chair by the big bell, with an old slouch hat hanging
on the back of it, when the flashes come.</p>
<p>Well, it being away in the night and stormy, and all so
mysterious-like, I felt just the way any other boy would a felt
when I see that wreck laying there so mournful and lonesome in the
middle of the river. &nbsp;I wanted to get aboard of her and slink
around a little, and see what there was there. &nbsp;So I says:</p>
<p>"Le's land on her, Jim."</p>
<p>But Jim was dead against it at first. &nbsp;He says:</p>
<p>"I doan' want to go fool'n 'long er no wrack. &nbsp;We's doin'
blame' well, en we better let blame' well alone, as de good book
says. &nbsp;Like as not dey's a watchman on dat wrack."</p>
<p>"Watchman your grandmother," I says; "there ain't nothing to
watch but the texas and the pilot-house; and do you reckon
anybody's going to resk his life for a texas and a pilot-house such
a night as this, when it's likely to break up and wash off down the
river any minute?" &nbsp;Jim couldn't say nothing to that, so he
didn't try. &nbsp;"And besides," I says, "we might borrow something
worth having out of the captain's stateroom. &nbsp;Seegars, I bet
you&mdash;and cost five cents apiece, solid cash. &nbsp;Steamboat
captains is always rich, and get sixty dollars a month, and THEY
don't care a cent what a thing costs, you know, long as they want
it. &nbsp;Stick a candle in your pocket; I can't rest, Jim, till we
give her a rummaging. &nbsp;Do you reckon Tom Sawyer would ever go
by this thing? &nbsp;Not for pie, he wouldn't. He'd call it an
adventure&mdash;that's what he'd call it; and he'd land on that
wreck if it was his last act. &nbsp;And wouldn't he throw style
into it?&mdash;wouldn't he spread himself, nor nothing? &nbsp;Why,
you'd think it was Christopher C'lumbus discovering Kingdom-Come.
&nbsp;I wish Tom Sawyer WAS here."</p>
<p>Jim he grumbled a little, but give in. &nbsp;He said we mustn't
talk any more than we could help, and then talk mighty low.
&nbsp;The lightning showed us the wreck again just in time, and we
fetched the stabboard derrick, and made fast there.</p>
<p>The deck was high out here. &nbsp;We went sneaking down the
slope of it to labboard, in the dark, towards the texas, feeling
our way slow with our feet, and spreading our hands out to fend off
the guys, for it was so dark we couldn't see no sign of them.
&nbsp;Pretty soon we struck the forward end of the skylight, and
clumb on to it; and the next step fetched us in front of the
captain's door, which was open, and by Jimminy, away down through
the texas-hall we see a light! and all in the same second we seem
to hear low voices in yonder!</p>
<p>Jim whispered and said he was feeling powerful sick, and told me
to come along. &nbsp;I says, all right, and was going to start for
the raft; but just then I heard a voice wail out and say:</p>
<p>"Oh, please don't, boys; I swear I won't ever tell!"</p>
<p>Another voice said, pretty loud:</p>
<p>"It's a lie, Jim Turner. &nbsp;You've acted this way before.
&nbsp;You always want more'n your share of the truck, and you've
always got it, too, because you've swore 't if you didn't you'd
tell. &nbsp;But this time you've said it jest one time too many.
&nbsp;You're the meanest, treacherousest hound in this
country."</p>
<p>By this time Jim was gone for the raft. &nbsp;I was just
a-biling with curiosity; and I says to myself, Tom Sawyer wouldn't
back out now, and so I won't either; I'm a-going to see what's
going on here. &nbsp;So I dropped on my hands and knees in the
little passage, and crept aft in the dark till there warn't but one
stateroom betwixt me and the cross-hall of the texas. &nbsp;Then in
there I see a man stretched on the floor and tied hand and foot,
and two men standing over him, and one of them had a dim lantern in
his hand, and the other one had a pistol. &nbsp;This one kept
pointing the pistol at the man's head on the floor, and saying:</p>
<p>"I'd LIKE to! &nbsp;And I orter, too&mdash;a mean skunk!"</p>
<br />
<br />
<a name="c12-098" id="c12-098"></a><br />
<br />
<img alt="c12-098.jpg (66K)" src="images/c12-098.jpg" height="498"
width="546" /><br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<p>The man on the floor would shrivel up and say, "Oh, please
don't, Bill; I hain't ever goin' to tell."</p>
<p>And every time he said that the man with the lantern would laugh
and say:</p>
<p>"'Deed you AIN'T! &nbsp;You never said no truer thing 'n that,
you bet you." And once he said: &nbsp;"Hear him beg! and yit if we
hadn't got the best of him and tied him he'd a killed us both.
&nbsp;And what FOR? &nbsp;Jist for noth'n. Jist because we stood on
our RIGHTS&mdash;that's what for. &nbsp;But I lay you ain't a-goin'
to threaten nobody any more, Jim Turner. &nbsp;Put UP that pistol,
Bill."</p>
<p>Bill says:</p>
<p>"I don't want to, Jake Packard. &nbsp;I'm for killin'
him&mdash;and didn't he kill old Hatfield jist the same
way&mdash;and don't he deserve it?"</p>
<p>"But I don't WANT him killed, and I've got my reasons for
it."</p>
<p>"Bless yo' heart for them words, Jake Packard! &nbsp;I'll never
forgit you long's I live!" says the man on the floor, sort of
blubbering.</p>
<p>Packard didn't take no notice of that, but hung up his lantern
on a nail and started towards where I was there in the dark, and
motioned Bill to come. &nbsp;I crawfished as fast as I could about
two yards, but the boat slanted so that I couldn't make very good
time; so to keep from getting run over and catched I crawled into a
stateroom on the upper side. &nbsp;The man came a-pawing along in
the dark, and when Packard got to my stateroom, he says:</p>
<p>"Here&mdash;come in here."</p>
<p>And in he come, and Bill after him. &nbsp;But before they got in
I was up in the upper berth, cornered, and sorry I come. &nbsp;Then
they stood there, with their hands on the ledge of the berth, and
talked. &nbsp;I couldn't see them, but I could tell where they was
by the whisky they'd been having. &nbsp;I was glad I didn't drink
whisky; but it wouldn't made much difference anyway, because most
of the time they couldn't a treed me because I didn't breathe.
&nbsp;I was too scared. &nbsp;And, besides, a body COULDN'T breathe
and hear such talk. &nbsp;They talked low and earnest. &nbsp;Bill
wanted to kill Turner. &nbsp;He says:</p>
<p>"He's said he'll tell, and he will. &nbsp;If we was to give both
our shares to him NOW it wouldn't make no difference after the row
and the way we've served him. &nbsp;Shore's you're born, he'll turn
State's evidence; now you hear ME. &nbsp;I'm for putting him out of
his troubles."</p>
<p>"So'm I," says Packard, very quiet.</p>
<p>"Blame it, I'd sorter begun to think you wasn't. &nbsp;Well,
then, that's all right. &nbsp;Le's go and do it."</p>
<p>"Hold on a minute; I hain't had my say yit. &nbsp;You listen to
me. Shooting's good, but there's quieter ways if the thing's GOT to
be done. But what I say is this: &nbsp;it ain't good sense to go
court'n around after a halter if you can git at what you're up to
in some way that's jist as good and at the same time don't bring
you into no resks. &nbsp;Ain't that so?"</p>
<p>"You bet it is. &nbsp;But how you goin' to manage it this
time?"</p>
<p>"Well, my idea is this: &nbsp;we'll rustle around and gather up
whatever pickins we've overlooked in the staterooms, and shove for
shore and hide the truck. Then we'll wait. &nbsp;Now I say it ain't
a-goin' to be more'n two hours befo' this wrack breaks up and
washes off down the river. &nbsp;See? He'll be drownded, and won't
have nobody to blame for it but his own self. &nbsp;I reckon that's
a considerble sight better 'n killin' of him. &nbsp;I'm unfavorable
to killin' a man as long as you can git aroun' it; it ain't good
sense, it ain't good morals. &nbsp;Ain't I right?"</p>
<br />

<br />
<br />
<br />
<p>"Yes, I reck'n you are. &nbsp;But s'pose she DON'T break up and
wash off?"</p>
<p>"Well, we can wait the two hours anyway and see, can't we?"</p>
<p>"All right, then; come along."</p>
<p>So they started, and I lit out, all in a cold sweat, and
scrambled forward. It was dark as pitch there; but I said, in a
kind of a coarse whisper, "Jim!" and he answered up, right at my
elbow, with a sort of a moan, and I says:</p>
<p>"Quick, Jim, it ain't no time for fooling around and moaning;
there's a gang of murderers in yonder, and if we don't hunt up
their boat and set her drifting down the river so these fellows
can't get away from the wreck there's one of 'em going to be in a
bad fix. &nbsp;But if we find their boat we can put ALL of 'em in a
bad fix&mdash;for the sheriff 'll get 'em. Quick&mdash;hurry!
&nbsp;I'll hunt the labboard side, you hunt the stabboard. You
start at the raft, and&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Oh, my lordy, lordy! &nbsp;RAF'? &nbsp;Dey ain' no raf' no mo';
she done broke loose en gone I&mdash;en here we is!"</p>

CHAPTER XIII.</p>
<p>WELL, I catched my breath and most fainted. &nbsp;Shut up on a
wreck with such a gang as that! &nbsp;But it warn't no time to be
sentimentering. &nbsp;We'd GOT to find that boat now&mdash;had to
have it for ourselves. &nbsp;So we went a-quaking and shaking down
the stabboard side, and slow work it was, too&mdash;seemed a week
before we got to the stern. &nbsp;No sign of a boat. &nbsp;Jim said
he didn't believe he could go any further&mdash;so scared he hadn't
hardly any strength left, he said. &nbsp;But I said, come on, if we
get left on this wreck we are in a fix, sure. &nbsp;So on we
prowled again. &nbsp;We struck for the stern of the texas, and
found it, and then scrabbled along forwards on the skylight,
hanging on from shutter to shutter, for the edge of the skylight
was in the water. &nbsp;When we got pretty close to the cross-hall
door there was the skiff, sure enough! &nbsp;I could just barely
see her. &nbsp;I felt ever so thankful. &nbsp;In another second I
would a been aboard of her, but just then the door opened.
&nbsp;One of the men stuck his head out only about a couple of foot
from me, and I thought I was gone; but he jerked it in again, and
says:</p>
<p>"Heave that blame lantern out o' sight, Bill!"</p>
<p>He flung a bag of something into the boat, and then got in
himself and set down. &nbsp;It was Packard. &nbsp;Then Bill HE come
out and got in. &nbsp;Packard says, in a low voice:</p>
<p>"All ready&mdash;shove off!"</p>
<p>I couldn't hardly hang on to the shutters, I was so weak.
&nbsp;But Bill says:</p>
<p>"Hold on&mdash;'d you go through him?"</p>
<p>"No. &nbsp;Didn't you?"</p>
<p>"No. &nbsp;So he's got his share o' the cash yet."</p>
<p>"Well, then, come along; no use to take truck and leave
money."</p>
<p>"Say, won't he suspicion what we're up to?"</p>
<p>"Maybe he won't. &nbsp;But we got to have it anyway. Come
along."</p>
<p>So they got out and went in.</p>
<p>The door slammed to because it was on the careened side; and in
a half second I was in the boat, and Jim come tumbling after me.
&nbsp;I out with my knife and cut the rope, and away we went!</p>
<p>We didn't touch an oar, and we didn't speak nor whisper, nor
hardly even breathe. &nbsp;We went gliding swift along, dead
silent, past the tip of the paddle-box, and past the stern; then in
a second or two more we was a hundred yards below the wreck, and
the darkness soaked her up, every last sign of her, and we was
safe, and knowed it.</p>
<p>When we was three or four hundred yards down-stream we see the
lantern show like a little spark at the texas door for a second,
and we knowed by that that the rascals had missed their boat, and
was beginning to understand that they was in just as much trouble
now as Jim Turner was.</p>
<p>Then Jim manned the oars, and we took out after our raft.
&nbsp;Now was the first time that I begun to worry about the
men&mdash;I reckon I hadn't had time to before. &nbsp;I begun to
think how dreadful it was, even for murderers, to be in such a fix.
&nbsp;I says to myself, there ain't no telling but I might come to
be a murderer myself yet, and then how would I like it? &nbsp;So
says I to Jim:</p>
<p>"The first light we see we'll land a hundred yards below it or
above it, in a place where it's a good hiding-place for you and the
skiff, and then I'll go and fix up some kind of a yarn, and get
somebody to go for that gang and get them out of their scrape, so
they can be hung when their time comes."</p>
<p>But that idea was a failure; for pretty soon it begun to storm
again, and this time worse than ever. &nbsp;The rain poured down,
and never a light showed; everybody in bed, I reckon. &nbsp;We
boomed along down the river, watching for lights and watching for
our raft. &nbsp;After a long time the rain let up, but the clouds
stayed, and the lightning kept whimpering, and by and by a flash
showed us a black thing ahead, floating, and we made for it.</p>
<p>It was the raft, and mighty glad was we to get aboard of it
again. &nbsp;We seen a light now away down to the right, on shore.
&nbsp;So I said I would go for it. The skiff was half full of
plunder which that gang had stole there on the wreck. &nbsp;We
hustled it on to the raft in a pile, and I told Jim to float along
down, and show a light when he judged he had gone about two mile,
and keep it burning till I come; then I manned my oars and shoved
for the light. &nbsp;As I got down towards it three or four more
showed&mdash;up on a hillside. &nbsp;It was a village. &nbsp;I
closed in above the shore light, and laid on my oars and floated.
&nbsp;As I went by I see it was a lantern hanging on the jackstaff
of a double-hull ferryboat. &nbsp;I skimmed around for the
watchman, a-wondering whereabouts he slept; and by and by I found
him roosting on the bitts forward, with his head down between his
knees. &nbsp;I gave his shoulder two or three little shoves, and
begun to cry.</p>
<p>He stirred up in a kind of a startlish way; but when he see it
was only me he took a good gap and stretch, and then he says:</p>
<p>"Hello, what's up? &nbsp;Don't cry, bub. &nbsp;What's the
trouble?"</p>
<br />
<br />
<a name="c13-104" id="c13-104"></a><br />

<img alt="c13-104.jpg (69K)" src="images/c13-104.jpg" height="498"
width="554" /><br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<p>I says:</p>
<p>"Pap, and mam, and sis, and&mdash;"</p>
<p>Then I broke down. &nbsp;He says:</p>
<p>"Oh, dang it now, DON'T take on so; we all has to have our
troubles, and this 'n 'll come out all right. &nbsp;What's the
matter with 'em?"</p>
<p>"They're&mdash;they're&mdash;are you the watchman of the
boat?"</p>
<p>"Yes," he says, kind of pretty-well-satisfied like. &nbsp;"I'm
the captain and the owner and the mate and the pilot and watchman
and head deck-hand; and sometimes I'm the freight and passengers.
&nbsp;I ain't as rich as old Jim Hornback, and I can't be so blame'
generous and good to Tom, Dick, and Harry as what he is, and slam
around money the way he does; but I've told him a many a time 't I
wouldn't trade places with him; for, says I, a sailor's life's the
life for me, and I'm derned if I'D live two mile out o' town, where
there ain't nothing ever goin' on, not for all his spondulicks and
as much more on top of it. &nbsp;Says I&mdash;"</p>
<p>I broke in and says:</p>
<p>"They're in an awful peck of trouble, and&mdash;"</p>
<p>"WHO is?"</p>
<p>"Why, pap and mam and sis and Miss Hooker; and if you'd take
your ferryboat and go up there&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Up where? &nbsp;Where are they?"</p>
<p>"On the wreck."</p>
<p>"What wreck?"</p>
<p>"Why, there ain't but one."</p>
<p>"What, you don't mean the Walter Scott?"</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>"Good land! what are they doin' THERE, for gracious sakes?"</p>
<p>"Well, they didn't go there a-purpose."</p>
<p>"I bet they didn't! &nbsp;Why, great goodness, there ain't no
chance for 'em if they don't git off mighty quick! &nbsp;Why, how
in the nation did they ever git into such a scrape?"</p>
<p>"Easy enough. &nbsp;Miss Hooker was a-visiting up there to the
town&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Yes, Booth's Landing&mdash;go on."</p>
<p>"She was a-visiting there at Booth's Landing, and just in the
edge of the evening she started over with her nigger woman in the
horse-ferry to stay all night at her friend's house, Miss
What-you-may-call-her I disremember her name&mdash;and they lost
their steering-oar, and swung around and went a-floating down,
stern first, about two mile, and saddle-baggsed on the wreck, and
the ferryman and the nigger woman and the horses was all lost, but
Miss Hooker she made a grab and got aboard the wreck. &nbsp;Well,
about an hour after dark we come along down in our trading-scow,
and it was so dark we didn't notice the wreck till we was right on
it; and so WE saddle-baggsed; but all of us was saved but Bill
Whipple&mdash;and oh, he WAS the best cretur!&mdash;I most wish 't
it had been me, I do."</p>
<p>"My George! &nbsp;It's the beatenest thing I ever struck.
&nbsp;And THEN what did you all do?"</p>
<p>"Well, we hollered and took on, but it's so wide there we
couldn't make nobody hear. &nbsp;So pap said somebody got to get
ashore and get help somehow. I was the only one that could swim, so
I made a dash for it, and Miss Hooker she said if I didn't strike
help sooner, come here and hunt up her uncle, and he'd fix the
thing. &nbsp;I made the land about a mile below, and been fooling
along ever since, trying to get people to do something, but they
said, 'What, in such a night and such a current? There ain't no
sense in it; go for the steam ferry.' &nbsp;Now if you'll go
and&mdash;"</p>
<p>"By Jackson, I'd LIKE to, and, blame it, I don't know but I
will; but who in the dingnation's a-going' to PAY for it? &nbsp;Do
you reckon your pap&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Why THAT'S all right. &nbsp;Miss Hooker she tole me,
PARTICULAR, that her uncle Hornback&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Great guns! is HE her uncle? &nbsp;Looky here, you break for
that light over yonder-way, and turn out west when you git there,
and about a quarter of a mile out you'll come to the tavern; tell
'em to dart you out to Jim Hornback's, and he'll foot the bill.
&nbsp;And don't you fool around any, because he'll want to know the
news. &nbsp;Tell him I'll have his niece all safe before he can get
to town. &nbsp;Hump yourself, now; I'm a-going up around the corner
here to roust out my engineer."</p>
<p>I struck for the light, but as soon as he turned the corner I
went back and got into my skiff and bailed her out, and then pulled
up shore in the easy water about six hundred yards, and tucked
myself in among some woodboats; for I couldn't rest easy till I
could see the ferryboat start. But take it all around, I was
feeling ruther comfortable on accounts of taking all this trouble
for that gang, for not many would a done it. &nbsp;I wished the
widow knowed about it. &nbsp;I judged she would be proud of me for
helping these rapscallions, because rapscallions and dead beats is
the kind the widow and good people takes the most interest in.</p>

<br />
<br />
<br />
<p>Well, before long here comes the wreck, dim and dusky, sliding
along down! A kind of cold shiver went through me, and then I
struck out for her. &nbsp;She was very deep, and I see in a minute
there warn't much chance for anybody being alive in her. &nbsp;I
pulled all around her and hollered a little, but there wasn't any
answer; all dead still. &nbsp;I felt a little bit heavy-hearted
about the gang, but not much, for I reckoned if they could stand it
I could.</p>
<p>Then here comes the ferryboat; so I shoved for the middle of the
river on a long down-stream slant; and when I judged I was out of
eye-reach I laid on my oars, and looked back and see her go and
smell around the wreck for Miss Hooker's remainders, because the
captain would know her uncle Hornback would want them; and then
pretty soon the ferryboat give it up and went for the shore, and I
laid into my work and went a-booming down the river.</p>
<p>It did seem a powerful long time before Jim's light showed up;
and when it did show it looked like it was a thousand mile off.
&nbsp;By the time I got there the sky was beginning to get a little
gray in the east; so we struck for an island, and hid the raft, and
sunk the skiff, and turned in and slept like dead people.</p>

CHAPTER XIV.</p>
<p>BY and by, when we got up, we turned over the truck the gang had
stole off of the wreck, and found boots, and blankets, and clothes,
and all sorts of other things, and a lot of books, and a spyglass,
and three boxes of seegars. &nbsp;We hadn't ever been this rich
before in neither of our lives. &nbsp;The seegars was prime.
&nbsp;We laid off all the afternoon in the woods talking, and me
reading the books, and having a general good time. I told Jim all
about what happened inside the wreck and at the ferryboat, and I
said these kinds of things was adventures; but he said he didn't
want no more adventures. &nbsp;He said that when I went in the
texas and he crawled back to get on the raft and found her gone he
nearly died, because he judged it was all up with HIM anyway it
could be fixed; for if he didn't get saved he would get drownded;
and if he did get saved, whoever saved him would send him back home
so as to get the reward, and then Miss Watson would sell him South,
sure. &nbsp;Well, he was right; he was most always right; he had an
uncommon level head for a nigger.</p>
<p>I read considerable to Jim about kings and dukes and earls and
such, and how gaudy they dressed, and how much style they put on,
and called each other your majesty, and your grace, and your
lordship, and so on, 'stead of mister; and Jim's eyes bugged out,
and he was interested. &nbsp;He says:</p>
<p>"I didn' know dey was so many un um. &nbsp;I hain't hearn 'bout
none un um, skasely, but ole King Sollermun, onless you counts dem
kings dat's in a pack er k'yards. &nbsp;How much do a king
git?"</p>
<p>"Get?" &nbsp;I says; "why, they get a thousand dollars a month
if they want it; they can have just as much as they want;
everything belongs to them."</p>
<p>"AIN' dat gay? &nbsp;En what dey got to do, Huck?"</p>
<p>"THEY don't do nothing! &nbsp;Why, how you talk! They just set
around."</p>
<p>"No; is dat so?"</p>
<p>"Of course it is. &nbsp;They just set around&mdash;except,
maybe, when there's a war; then they go to the war. &nbsp;But other
times they just lazy around; or go hawking&mdash;just hawking and
sp&mdash;Sh!&mdash;d' you hear a noise?"</p>
<p>We skipped out and looked; but it warn't nothing but the flutter
of a steamboat's wheel away down, coming around the point; so we
come back.</p>
<p>"Yes," says I, "and other times, when things is dull, they fuss
with the parlyment; and if everybody don't go just so he whacks
their heads off. But mostly they hang round the harem."</p>
<p>"Roun' de which?"</p>
<p>"Harem."</p>
<p>"What's de harem?"</p>
<br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
<br />
<p>"The place where he keeps his wives. &nbsp;Don't you know about
the harem? Solomon had one; he had about a million wives."</p>
<p>"Why, yes, dat's so; I&mdash;I'd done forgot it. &nbsp;A harem's
a bo'd'n-house, I reck'n. &nbsp;Mos' likely dey has rackety times
in de nussery. &nbsp;En I reck'n de wives quarrels considable; en
dat 'crease de racket. &nbsp;Yit dey say Sollermun de wises' man
dat ever live'. &nbsp;I doan' take no stock in dat. Bekase why:
would a wise man want to live in de mids' er sich a blim-blammin'
all de time? &nbsp;No&mdash;'deed he wouldn't. &nbsp;A wise man 'ud
take en buil' a biler-factry; en den he could shet DOWN de
biler-factry when he want to res'."</p>
<p>"Well, but he WAS the wisest man, anyway; because the widow she
told me so, her own self."</p>
<p>"I doan k'yer what de widder say, he WARN'T no wise man nuther.
&nbsp;He had some er de dad-fetchedes' ways I ever see. &nbsp;Does
you know 'bout dat chile dat he 'uz gwyne to chop in two?"</p>
<p>"Yes, the widow told me all about it."</p>
<p>"WELL, den! &nbsp;Warn' dat de beatenes' notion in de worl'?
&nbsp;You jes' take en look at it a minute. &nbsp;Dah's de stump,
dah&mdash;dat's one er de women; heah's you&mdash;dat's de yuther
one; I's Sollermun; en dish yer dollar bill's de chile. &nbsp;Bofe
un you claims it. &nbsp;What does I do? &nbsp;Does I shin aroun'
mongs' de neighbors en fine out which un you de bill DO b'long to,
en han' it over to de right one, all safe en soun', de way dat
anybody dat had any gumption would? &nbsp;No; I take en whack de
bill in TWO, en give half un it to you, en de yuther half to de
yuther woman. &nbsp;Dat's de way Sollermun was gwyne to do wid de
chile. &nbsp;Now I want to ast you: &nbsp;what's de use er dat half
a bill?&mdash;can't buy noth'n wid it. &nbsp;En what use is a half
a chile? &nbsp;I wouldn' give a dern for a million un um."</p>
<p>"But hang it, Jim, you've clean missed the point&mdash;blame it,
you've missed it a thousand mile."</p>
<p>"Who? &nbsp;Me? &nbsp;Go 'long. &nbsp;Doan' talk to me 'bout yo'
pints. &nbsp;I reck'n I knows sense when I sees it; en dey ain' no
sense in sich doin's as dat. De 'spute warn't 'bout a half a chile,
de 'spute was 'bout a whole chile; en de man dat think he kin
settle a 'spute 'bout a whole chile wid a half a chile doan' know
enough to come in out'n de rain. &nbsp;Doan' talk to me 'bout
Sollermun, Huck, I knows him by de back."</p>

<img alt="c14-112.jpg (65K)" src="images/c14-112.jpg" height="459"
width="605" /><br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<p>"But I tell you you don't get the point."</p>
<p>"Blame de point! &nbsp;I reck'n I knows what I knows. &nbsp;En
mine you, de REAL pint is down furder&mdash;it's down deeper.
&nbsp;It lays in de way Sollermun was raised. &nbsp;You take a man
dat's got on'y one or two chillen; is dat man gwyne to be waseful
o' chillen? &nbsp;No, he ain't; he can't 'ford it. &nbsp;HE know
how to value 'em. &nbsp;But you take a man dat's got 'bout five
million chillen runnin' roun' de house, en it's diffunt. &nbsp;HE
as soon chop a chile in two as a cat. Dey's plenty mo'. &nbsp;A
chile er two, mo' er less, warn't no consekens to Sollermun, dad
fatch him!"</p>
<p>I never see such a nigger. &nbsp;If he got a notion in his head
once, there warn't no getting it out again. &nbsp;He was the most
down on Solomon of any nigger I ever see. &nbsp;So I went to
talking about other kings, and let Solomon slide. &nbsp;I told
about Louis Sixteenth that got his head cut off in France long time
ago; and about his little boy the dolphin, that would a been a
king, but they took and shut him up in jail, and some say he died
there.</p>
<p>"Po' little chap."</p>
<p>"But some says he got out and got away, and come to
America."</p>
<p>"Dat's good! &nbsp;But he'll be pooty lonesome&mdash;dey ain' no
kings here, is dey, Huck?"</p>
<p>"No."</p>
<p>"Den he cain't git no situation. &nbsp;What he gwyne to do?"</p>
<p>"Well, I don't know. &nbsp;Some of them gets on the police, and
some of them learns people how to talk French."</p>
<p>"Why, Huck, doan' de French people talk de same way we
does?"</p>
<p>"NO, Jim; you couldn't understand a word they said&mdash;not a
single word."</p>
<p>"Well, now, I be ding-busted! &nbsp;How do dat come?"</p>
<p>"I don't know; but it's so. &nbsp;I got some of their jabber out
of a book. S'pose a man was to come to you and say
Polly-voo-franzy&mdash;what would you think?"</p>
<p>"I wouldn' think nuff'n; I'd take en bust him over de
head&mdash;dat is, if he warn't white. &nbsp;I wouldn't 'low no
nigger to call me dat."</p>
<p>"Shucks, it ain't calling you anything. &nbsp;It's only saying,
do you know how to talk French?"</p>
<p>"Well, den, why couldn't he SAY it?"</p>
<p>"Why, he IS a-saying it. &nbsp;That's a Frenchman's WAY of
saying it."</p>
<p>"Well, it's a blame ridicklous way, en I doan' want to hear no
mo' 'bout it. &nbsp;Dey ain' no sense in it."</p>
<p>"Looky here, Jim; does a cat talk like we do?"</p>
<p>"No, a cat don't."</p>
<p>"Well, does a cow?"</p>
<p>"No, a cow don't, nuther."</p>
<p>"Does a cat talk like a cow, or a cow talk like a cat?"</p>
<p>"No, dey don't."</p>
<p>"It's natural and right for 'em to talk different from each
other, ain't it?"</p>
<p>"Course."</p>
<p>"And ain't it natural and right for a cat and a cow to talk
different from US?"</p>
<p>"Why, mos' sholy it is."</p>
<p>"Well, then, why ain't it natural and right for a FRENCHMAN to
talk different from us? &nbsp;You answer me that."</p>
<p>"Is a cat a man, Huck?"</p>
<p>"No."</p>
<p>"Well, den, dey ain't no sense in a cat talkin' like a man.
&nbsp;Is a cow a man?&mdash;er is a cow a cat?"</p>
<p>"No, she ain't either of them."</p>
<p>"Well, den, she ain't got no business to talk like either one er
the yuther of 'em. &nbsp;Is a Frenchman a man?"</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>"WELL, den! &nbsp;Dad blame it, why doan' he TALK like a man?
&nbsp;You answer me DAT!"</p>
<p>I see it warn't no use wasting words&mdash;you can't learn a
nigger to argue. So I quit.</p>

CHAPTER XV.</p>
<p>WE judged that three nights more would fetch us to Cairo, at the
bottom of Illinois, where the Ohio River comes in, and that was
what we was after. &nbsp;We would sell the raft and get on a
steamboat and go way up the Ohio amongst the free States, and then
be out of trouble.</p>
<p>Well, the second night a fog begun to come on, and we made for a
towhead to tie to, for it wouldn't do to try to run in a fog; but
when I paddled ahead in the canoe, with the line to make fast,
there warn't anything but little saplings to tie to. &nbsp;I passed
the line around one of them right on the edge of the cut bank, but
there was a stiff current, and the raft come booming down so lively
she tore it out by the roots and away she went. &nbsp;I see the fog
closing down, and it made me so sick and scared I couldn't budge
for most a half a minute it seemed to me&mdash;and then there
warn't no raft in sight; you couldn't see twenty yards. &nbsp;I
jumped into the canoe and run back to the stern, and grabbed the
paddle and set her back a stroke. &nbsp;But she didn't come.
&nbsp;I was in such a hurry I hadn't untied her. &nbsp;I got up and
tried to untie her, but I was so excited my hands shook so I
couldn't hardly do anything with them.</p>
<p>As soon as I got started I took out after the raft, hot and
heavy, right down the towhead. &nbsp;That was all right as far as
it went, but the towhead warn't sixty yards long, and the minute I
flew by the foot of it I shot out into the solid white fog, and
hadn't no more idea which way I was going than a dead man.</p>
<p>Thinks I, it won't do to paddle; first I know I'll run into the
bank or a towhead or something; I got to set still and float, and
yet it's mighty fidgety business to have to hold your hands still
at such a time. &nbsp;I whooped and listened. &nbsp;Away down there
somewheres I hears a small whoop, and up comes my spirits. &nbsp;I
went tearing after it, listening sharp to hear it again. &nbsp;The
next time it come I see I warn't heading for it, but heading away
to the right of it. &nbsp;And the next time I was heading away to
the left of it&mdash;and not gaining on it much either, for I was
flying around, this way and that and t'other, but it was going
straight ahead all the time.</p>
<p>I did wish the fool would think to beat a tin pan, and beat it
all the time, but he never did, and it was the still places between
the whoops that was making the trouble for me. &nbsp;Well, I fought
along, and directly I hears the whoop BEHIND me. &nbsp;I was
tangled good now. &nbsp;That was somebody else's whoop, or else I
was turned around.</p>
<p>I throwed the paddle down. &nbsp;I heard the whoop again; it was
behind me yet, but in a different place; it kept coming, and kept
changing its place, and I kept answering, till by and by it was in
front of me again, and I knowed the current had swung the canoe's
head down-stream, and I was all right if that was Jim and not some
other raftsman hollering. &nbsp;I couldn't tell nothing about
voices in a fog, for nothing don't look natural nor sound natural
in a fog.</p>
<p>The whooping went on, and in about a minute I come a-booming
down on a cut bank with smoky ghosts of big trees on it, and the
current throwed me off to the left and shot by, amongst a lot of
snags that fairly roared, the currrent was tearing by them so
swift.</p>
<p>In another second or two it was solid white and still again.
&nbsp;I set perfectly still then, listening to my heart thump, and
I reckon I didn't draw a breath while it thumped a hundred.</p>
<p>I just give up then. &nbsp;I knowed what the matter was.
&nbsp;That cut bank was an island, and Jim had gone down t'other
side of it. &nbsp;It warn't no towhead that you could float by in
ten minutes. &nbsp;It had the big timber of a regular island; it
might be five or six miles long and more than half a mile wide.</p>
<p>I kept quiet, with my ears cocked, about fifteen minutes, I
reckon. &nbsp;I was floating along, of course, four or five miles
an hour; but you don't ever think of that. &nbsp;No, you FEEL like
you are laying dead still on the water; and if a little glimpse of
a snag slips by you don't think to yourself how fast YOU'RE going,
but you catch your breath and think, my! how that snag's tearing
along. &nbsp;If you think it ain't dismal and lonesome out in a fog
that way by yourself in the night, you try it once&mdash;you'll
see.</p>

width="608" /><br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<p>Next, for about a half an hour, I whoops now and then; at last I
hears the answer a long ways off, and tries to follow it, but I
couldn't do it, and directly I judged I'd got into a nest of
towheads, for I had little dim glimpses of them on both sides of
me&mdash;sometimes just a narrow channel between, and some that I
couldn't see I knowed was there because I'd hear the wash of the
current against the old dead brush and trash that hung over the
banks. &nbsp;Well, I warn't long loosing the whoops down amongst
the towheads; and I only tried to chase them a little while,
anyway, because it was worse than chasing a Jack-o'-lantern.
&nbsp;You never knowed a sound dodge around so, and swap places so
quick and so much.</p>
<p>I had to claw away from the bank pretty lively four or five
times, to keep from knocking the islands out of the river; and so I
judged the raft must be butting into the bank every now and then,
or else it would get further ahead and clear out of
hearing&mdash;it was floating a little faster than what I was.</p>
<p>Well, I seemed to be in the open river again by and by, but I
couldn't hear no sign of a whoop nowheres. &nbsp;I reckoned Jim had
fetched up on a snag, maybe, and it was all up with him. &nbsp;I
was good and tired, so I laid down in the canoe and said I wouldn't
bother no more. &nbsp;I didn't want to go to sleep, of course; but
I was so sleepy I couldn't help it; so I thought I would take jest
one little cat-nap.</p>
<br />
<br />
<a name="c15-118" id="c15-118"></a><br />
<br />
<img alt="c15-118.jpg (78K)" src="images/c15-118.jpg" height="451"
width="616" /><br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<p>But I reckon it was more than a cat-nap, for when I waked up the
stars was shining bright, the fog was all gone, and I was spinning
down a big bend stern first. &nbsp;First I didn't know where I was;
I thought I was dreaming; and when things began to come back to me
they seemed to come up dim out of last week.</p>
<p>It was a monstrous big river here, with the tallest and the
thickest kind of timber on both banks; just a solid wall, as well
as I could see by the stars. &nbsp;I looked away down-stream, and
seen a black speck on the water. I took after it; but when I got to
it it warn't nothing but a couple of sawlogs made fast together.
&nbsp;Then I see another speck, and chased that; then another, and
this time I was right. &nbsp;It was the raft.</p>
<p>When I got to it Jim was setting there with his head down
between his knees, asleep, with his right arm hanging over the
steering-oar. &nbsp;The other oar was smashed off, and the raft was
littered up with leaves and branches and dirt. &nbsp;So she'd had a
rough time.</p>
<p>I made fast and laid down under Jim's nose on the raft, and
began to gap, and stretch my fists out against Jim, and says:</p>
<p>"Hello, Jim, have I been asleep? &nbsp;Why didn't you stir me
up?"</p>
<p>"Goodness gracious, is dat you, Huck? &nbsp;En you ain'
dead&mdash;you ain' drownded&mdash;you's back agin? &nbsp;It's too
good for true, honey, it's too good for true. Lemme look at you
chile, lemme feel o' you. &nbsp;No, you ain' dead! you's back agin,
'live en soun', jis de same ole Huck&mdash;de same ole Huck, thanks
to goodness!"</p>
<p>"What's the matter with you, Jim? &nbsp;You been
a-drinking?"</p>
<p>"Drinkin'? &nbsp;Has I ben a-drinkin'? &nbsp;Has I had a chance
to be a-drinkin'?"</p>
<p>"Well, then, what makes you talk so wild?"</p>
<p>"How does I talk wild?"</p>
<p>"HOW? &nbsp;Why, hain't you been talking about my coming back,
and all that stuff, as if I'd been gone away?"</p>
<p>"Huck&mdash;Huck Finn, you look me in de eye; look me in de eye.
&nbsp;HAIN'T you ben gone away?"</p>
<p>"Gone away? &nbsp;Why, what in the nation do you mean? &nbsp;I
hain't been gone anywheres. &nbsp;Where would I go to?"</p>
<p>"Well, looky here, boss, dey's sumf'n wrong, dey is. &nbsp;Is I
ME, or who IS I? Is I heah, or whah IS I? &nbsp;Now dat's what I
wants to know."</p>
<p>"Well, I think you're here, plain enough, but I think you're a
tangle-headed old fool, Jim."</p>
<p>"I is, is I? &nbsp;Well, you answer me dis: &nbsp;Didn't you
tote out de line in de canoe fer to make fas' to de tow-head?"</p>
<p>"No, I didn't. &nbsp;What tow-head? &nbsp;I hain't see no
tow-head."</p>
<p>"You hain't seen no towhead? &nbsp;Looky here, didn't de line
pull loose en de raf' go a-hummin' down de river, en leave you en
de canoe behine in de fog?"</p>
<p>"What fog?"</p>
<p>"Why, de fog!&mdash;de fog dat's been aroun' all night. &nbsp;En
didn't you whoop, en didn't I whoop, tell we got mix' up in de
islands en one un us got los' en t'other one was jis' as good as
los', 'kase he didn' know whah he wuz? En didn't I bust up agin a
lot er dem islands en have a turrible time en mos' git drownded?
&nbsp;Now ain' dat so, boss&mdash;ain't it so? &nbsp;You answer me
dat."</p>
<p>"Well, this is too many for me, Jim. &nbsp;I hain't seen no fog,
nor no islands, nor no troubles, nor nothing. &nbsp;I been setting
here talking with you all night till you went to sleep about ten
minutes ago, and I reckon I done the same. &nbsp;You couldn't a got
drunk in that time, so of course you've been dreaming."</p>
<p>"Dad fetch it, how is I gwyne to dream all dat in ten
minutes?"</p>
<p>"Well, hang it all, you did dream it, because there didn't any
of it happen."</p>
<p>"But, Huck, it's all jis' as plain to me as&mdash;"</p>
<p>"It don't make no difference how plain it is; there ain't
nothing in it. I know, because I've been here all the time."</p>
<p>Jim didn't say nothing for about five minutes, but set there
studying over it. &nbsp;Then he says:</p>
<p>"Well, den, I reck'n I did dream it, Huck; but dog my cats ef it
ain't de powerfullest dream I ever see. &nbsp;En I hain't ever had
no dream b'fo' dat's tired me like dis one."</p>
<p>"Oh, well, that's all right, because a dream does tire a body
like everything sometimes. &nbsp;But this one was a staving dream;
tell me all about it, Jim."</p>
<p>So Jim went to work and told me the whole thing right through,
just as it happened, only he painted it up considerable. &nbsp;Then
he said he must start in and "'terpret" it, because it was sent for
a warning. &nbsp;He said the first towhead stood for a man that
would try to do us some good, but the current was another man that
would get us away from him. &nbsp;The whoops was warnings that
would come to us every now and then, and if we didn't try hard to
make out to understand them they'd just take us into bad luck,
'stead of keeping us out of it. &nbsp;The lot of towheads was
troubles we was going to get into with quarrelsome people and all
kinds of mean folks, but if we minded our business and didn't talk
back and aggravate them, we would pull through and get out of the
fog and into the big clear river, which was the free States, and
wouldn't have no more trouble.</p>
<p>It had clouded up pretty dark just after I got on to the raft,
but it was clearing up again now.</p>
<p>"Oh, well, that's all interpreted well enough as far as it goes,
Jim," I says; "but what does THESE things stand for?"</p>
<p>It was the leaves and rubbish on the raft and the smashed oar.
&nbsp;You could see them first-rate now.</p>
<p>Jim looked at the trash, and then looked at me, and back at the
trash again. &nbsp;He had got the dream fixed so strong in his head
that he couldn't seem to shake it loose and get the facts back into
its place again right away. &nbsp;But when he did get the thing
straightened around he looked at me steady without ever smiling,
and says:</p>
<p>"What do dey stan' for? &nbsp;I'se gwyne to tell you. &nbsp;When
I got all wore out wid work, en wid de callin' for you, en went to
sleep, my heart wuz mos' broke bekase you wuz los', en I didn'
k'yer no' mo' what become er me en de raf'. &nbsp;En when I wake up
en fine you back agin, all safe en soun', de tears come, en I could
a got down on my knees en kiss yo' foot, I's so thankful. En all
you wuz thinkin' 'bout wuz how you could make a fool uv ole Jim wid
a lie. &nbsp;Dat truck dah is TRASH; en trash is what people is dat
puts dirt on de head er dey fren's en makes 'em ashamed."</p>
<p>Then he got up slow and walked to the wigwam, and went in there
without saying anything but that. &nbsp;But that was enough.
&nbsp;It made me feel so mean I could almost kissed HIS foot to get
him to take it back.</p>
<p>It was fifteen minutes before I could work myself up to go and
humble myself to a nigger; but I done it, and I warn't ever sorry
for it afterwards, neither. &nbsp;I didn't do him no more mean
tricks, and I wouldn't done that one if I'd a knowed it would make
him feel that way.</p>

CHAPTER XVI.</p>
<p>WE slept most all day, and started out at night, a little ways
behind a monstrous long raft that was as long going by as a
procession. &nbsp;She had four long sweeps at each end, so we
judged she carried as many as thirty men, likely. &nbsp;She had
five big wigwams aboard, wide apart, and an open camp fire in the
middle, and a tall flag-pole at each end. &nbsp;There was a power
of style about her. &nbsp;It AMOUNTED to something being a raftsman
on such a craft as that.</p>
<p>We went drifting down into a big bend, and the night clouded up
and got hot. &nbsp;The river was very wide, and was walled with
solid timber on both sides; you couldn't see a break in it hardly
ever, or a light. &nbsp;We talked about Cairo, and wondered whether
we would know it when we got to it. &nbsp;I said likely we
wouldn't, because I had heard say there warn't but about a dozen
houses there, and if they didn't happen to have them lit up, how
was we going to know we was passing a town? &nbsp;Jim said if the
two big rivers joined together there, that would show. &nbsp;But I
said maybe we might think we was passing the foot of an island and
coming into the same old river again. That disturbed Jim&mdash;and
me too. &nbsp;So the question was, what to do? &nbsp;I said, paddle
ashore the first time a light showed, and tell them pap was behind,
coming along with a trading-scow, and was a green hand at the
business, and wanted to know how far it was to Cairo. &nbsp;Jim
thought it was a good idea, so we took a smoke on it and
waited.</p>
<p>There warn't nothing to do now but to look out sharp for the
town, and not pass it without seeing it. &nbsp;He said he'd be
mighty sure to see it, because he'd be a free man the minute he
seen it, but if he missed it he'd be in a slave country again and
no more show for freedom. &nbsp;Every little while he jumps up and
says:</p>
<p>"Dah she is?"</p>
<p>But it warn't. &nbsp;It was Jack-o'-lanterns, or lightning bugs;
so he set down again, and went to watching, same as before.
&nbsp;Jim said it made him all over trembly and feverish to be so
close to freedom. &nbsp;Well, I can tell you it made me all over
trembly and feverish, too, to hear him, because I begun to get it
through my head that he WAS most free&mdash;and who was to blame
for it? &nbsp;Why, ME. &nbsp;I couldn't get that out of my
conscience, no how nor no way. It got to troubling me so I couldn't
rest; I couldn't stay still in one place. &nbsp;It hadn't ever come
home to me before, what this thing was that I was doing. &nbsp;But
now it did; and it stayed with me, and scorched me more and more.
&nbsp;I tried to make out to myself that I warn't to blame, because
I didn't run Jim off from his rightful owner; but it warn't no use,
conscience up and says, every time, "But you knowed he was running
for his freedom, and you could a paddled ashore and told somebody."
&nbsp;That was so&mdash;I couldn't get around that noway.
&nbsp;That was where it pinched. &nbsp;Conscience says to me, "What
had poor Miss Watson done to you that you could see her nigger go
off right under your eyes and never say one single word? &nbsp;What
did that poor old woman do to you that you could treat her so mean?
&nbsp;Why, she tried to learn you your book, she tried to learn you
your manners, she tried to be good to you every way she knowed how.
&nbsp;THAT'S what she done."</p>
<p>I got to feeling so mean and so miserable I most wished I was
dead. &nbsp;I fidgeted up and down the raft, abusing myself to
myself, and Jim was fidgeting up and down past me. &nbsp;We neither
of us could keep still. &nbsp;Every time he danced around and says,
"Dah's Cairo!" it went through me like a shot, and I thought if it
WAS Cairo I reckoned I would die of miserableness.</p>
<p>Jim talked out loud all the time while I was talking to myself.
&nbsp;He was saying how the first thing he would do when he got to
a free State he would go to saving up money and never spend a
single cent, and when he got enough he would buy his wife, which
was owned on a farm close to where Miss Watson lived; and then they
would both work to buy the two children, and if their master
wouldn't sell them, they'd get an Ab'litionist to go and steal
them.</p>
<p>It most froze me to hear such talk. &nbsp;He wouldn't ever dared
to talk such talk in his life before. &nbsp;Just see what a
difference it made in him the minute he judged he was about free.
&nbsp;It was according to the old saying, "Give a nigger an inch
and he'll take an ell." &nbsp;Thinks I, this is what comes of my
not thinking. &nbsp;Here was this nigger, which I had as good as
helped to run away, coming right out flat-footed and saying he
would steal his children&mdash;children that belonged to a man I
didn't even know; a man that hadn't ever done me no harm.</p>
<p>I was sorry to hear Jim say that, it was such a lowering of him.
&nbsp;My conscience got to stirring me up hotter than ever, until
at last I says to it, "Let up on me&mdash;it ain't too late
yet&mdash;I'll paddle ashore at the first light and tell." &nbsp;I
felt easy and happy and light as a feather right off. &nbsp;All my
troubles was gone. &nbsp;I went to looking out sharp for a light,
and sort of singing to myself. &nbsp;By and by one showed.
&nbsp;Jim sings out:</p>
<p>"We's safe, Huck, we's safe! &nbsp;Jump up and crack yo' heels!
&nbsp;Dat's de good ole Cairo at las', I jis knows it!"</p>
<p>I says:</p>
<p>"I'll take the canoe and go and see, Jim. &nbsp;It mightn't be,
you know."</p>
<p>He jumped and got the canoe ready, and put his old coat in the
bottom for me to set on, and give me the paddle; and as I shoved
off, he says:</p>
<p>"Pooty soon I'll be a-shout'n' for joy, en I'll say, it's all on
accounts o' Huck; I's a free man, en I couldn't ever ben free ef it
hadn' ben for Huck; Huck done it. &nbsp;Jim won't ever forgit you,
Huck; you's de bes' fren' Jim's ever had; en you's de ONLY fren'
ole Jim's got now."</p>
<p>I was paddling off, all in a sweat to tell on him; but when he
says this, it seemed to kind of take the tuck all out of me.
&nbsp;I went along slow then, and I warn't right down certain
whether I was glad I started or whether I warn't. &nbsp;When I was
fifty yards off, Jim says:</p>
<p>"Dah you goes, de ole true Huck; de on'y white genlman dat ever
kep' his promise to ole Jim."</p>
<p>Well, I just felt sick. &nbsp;But I says, I GOT to do it&mdash;I
can't get OUT of it. &nbsp;Right then along comes a skiff with two
men in it with guns, and they stopped and I stopped. &nbsp;One of
them says:</p>
<p>"What's that yonder?"</p>
<p>"A piece of a raft," I says.</p>
<p>"Do you belong on it?"</p>
<p>"Yes, sir."</p>
<p>"Any men on it?"</p>
<p>"Only one, sir."</p>
<p>"Well, there's five niggers run off to-night up yonder, above
the head of the bend. &nbsp;Is your man white or black?"</p>
<p>I didn't answer up prompt. &nbsp;I tried to, but the words
wouldn't come. I tried for a second or two to brace up and out with
it, but I warn't man enough&mdash;hadn't the spunk of a rabbit.
&nbsp;I see I was weakening; so I just give up trying, and up and
says:</p>
<p>"He's white."</p>
<p>"I reckon we'll go and see for ourselves."</p>
<p>"I wish you would," says I, "because it's pap that's there, and
maybe you'd help me tow the raft ashore where the light is.
&nbsp;He's sick&mdash;and so is mam and Mary Ann."</p>
<p>"Oh, the devil! we're in a hurry, boy. &nbsp;But I s'pose we've
got to. &nbsp;Come, buckle to your paddle, and let's get
along."</p>
<p>I buckled to my paddle and they laid to their oars. &nbsp;When
we had made a stroke or two, I says:</p>
<p>"Pap'll be mighty much obleeged to you, I can tell you.
&nbsp;Everybody goes away when I want them to help me tow the raft
ashore, and I can't do it by myself."</p>
<p>"Well, that's infernal mean. &nbsp;Odd, too. &nbsp;Say, boy,
what's the matter with your father?"</p>
<p>"It's the&mdash;a&mdash;the&mdash;well, it ain't anything
much."</p>
<p>They stopped pulling. &nbsp;It warn't but a mighty little ways
to the raft now. One says:</p>
<p>"Boy, that's a lie. &nbsp;What IS the matter with your pap?
&nbsp;Answer up square now, and it'll be the better for you."</p>

<p>"I will, sir, I will, honest&mdash;but don't leave us, please.
&nbsp;It's the&mdash;the&mdash;Gentlemen, if you'll only pull
ahead, and let me heave you the headline, you won't have to come
a-near the raft&mdash;please do."</p>
<p>"Set her back, John, set her back!" says one. &nbsp;They backed
water. &nbsp;"Keep away, boy&mdash;keep to looard. &nbsp;Confound
it, I just expect the wind has blowed it to us. &nbsp;Your pap's
got the small-pox, and you know it precious well. &nbsp;Why didn't
you come out and say so? &nbsp;Do you want to spread it all
over?"</p>
<p>"Well," says I, a-blubbering, "I've told everybody before, and
they just went away and left us."</p>
<p>"Poor devil, there's something in that. &nbsp;We are right down
sorry for you, but we&mdash;well, hang it, we don't want the
small-pox, you see. &nbsp;Look here, I'll tell you what to do.
&nbsp;Don't you try to land by yourself, or you'll smash everything
to pieces. &nbsp;You float along down about twenty miles, and
you'll come to a town on the left-hand side of the river. &nbsp;It
will be long after sun-up then, and when you ask for help you tell
them your folks are all down with chills and fever. &nbsp;Don't be
a fool again, and let people guess what is the matter. &nbsp;Now
we're trying to do you a kindness; so you just put twenty miles
between us, that's a good boy. &nbsp;It wouldn't do any good to
land yonder where the light is&mdash;it's only a wood-yard. Say, I
reckon your father's poor, and I'm bound to say he's in pretty hard
luck. &nbsp;Here, I'll put a twenty-dollar gold piece on this
board, and you get it when it floats by. &nbsp;I feel mighty mean
to leave you; but my kingdom! it won't do to fool with small-pox,
don't you see?"</p>
<p>"Hold on, Parker," says the other man, "here's a twenty to put
on the board for me. &nbsp;Good-bye, boy; you do as Mr. Parker told
you, and you'll be all right."</p>
<p>"That's so, my boy&mdash;good-bye, good-bye. &nbsp;If you see
any runaway niggers you get help and nab them, and you can make
some money by it."</p>
<p>"Good-bye, sir," says I; "I won't let no runaway niggers get by
me if I can help it."</p>
<p>They went off and I got aboard the raft, feeling bad and low,
because I knowed very well I had done wrong, and I see it warn't no
use for me to try to learn to do right; a body that don't get
STARTED right when he's little ain't got no show&mdash;when the
pinch comes there ain't nothing to back him up and keep him to his
work, and so he gets beat. &nbsp;Then I thought a minute, and says
to myself, hold on; s'pose you'd a done right and give Jim up,
would you felt better than what you do now? &nbsp;No, says I, I'd
feel bad&mdash;I'd feel just the same way I do now. &nbsp;Well,
then, says I, what's the use you learning to do right when it's
troublesome to do right and ain't no trouble to do wrong, and the
wages is just the same? &nbsp;I was stuck. &nbsp;I couldn't answer
that. &nbsp;So I reckoned I wouldn't bother no more about it, but
after this always do whichever come handiest at the time.</p>
<p>I went into the wigwam; Jim warn't there. &nbsp;I looked all
around; he warn't anywhere. &nbsp;I says:</p>
<p>"Jim!"</p>
<p>"Here I is, Huck. &nbsp;Is dey out o' sight yit? &nbsp;Don't
talk loud."</p>

<br />
<p>He was in the river under the stern oar, with just his nose out.
&nbsp;I told him they were out of sight, so he come aboard.
&nbsp;He says:</p>
<p>"I was a-listenin' to all de talk, en I slips into de river en
was gwyne to shove for sho' if dey come aboard. &nbsp;Den I was
gwyne to swim to de raf' agin when dey was gone. &nbsp;But lawsy,
how you did fool 'em, Huck! &nbsp;Dat WUZ de smartes' dodge!
&nbsp;I tell you, chile, I'spec it save' ole Jim&mdash;ole Jim
ain't going to forgit you for dat, honey."</p>
<p>Then we talked about the money. &nbsp;It was a pretty good
raise&mdash;twenty dollars apiece. &nbsp;Jim said we could take
deck passage on a steamboat now, and the money would last us as far
as we wanted to go in the free States. He said twenty mile more
warn't far for the raft to go, but he wished we was already
there.</p>
<p>Towards daybreak we tied up, and Jim was mighty particular about
hiding the raft good. &nbsp;Then he worked all day fixing things in
bundles, and getting all ready to quit rafting.</p>
<p>That night about ten we hove in sight of the lights of a town
away down in a left-hand bend.</p>
<p>I went off in the canoe to ask about it. &nbsp;Pretty soon I
found a man out in the river with a skiff, setting a trot-line.
&nbsp;I ranged up and says:</p>
<p>"Mister, is that town Cairo?"</p>
<p>"Cairo? no. &nbsp;You must be a blame' fool."</p>
<p>"What town is it, mister?"</p>
<p>"If you want to know, go and find out. &nbsp;If you stay here
botherin' around me for about a half a minute longer you'll get
something you won't want."</p>
<p>I paddled to the raft. &nbsp;Jim was awful disappointed, but I
said never mind, Cairo would be the next place, I reckoned.</p>
<p>We passed another town before daylight, and I was going out
again; but it was high ground, so I didn't go. &nbsp;No high ground
about Cairo, Jim said. I had forgot it. &nbsp;We laid up for the
day on a towhead tolerable close to the left-hand bank. &nbsp;I
begun to suspicion something. &nbsp;So did Jim. &nbsp;I says:</p>
<p>"Maybe we went by Cairo in the fog that night."</p>
<p>He says:</p>
<p>"Doan' le's talk about it, Huck. &nbsp;Po' niggers can't have no
luck. &nbsp;I awluz 'spected dat rattlesnake-skin warn't done wid
its work."</p>
<p>"I wish I'd never seen that snake-skin, Jim&mdash;I do wish I'd
never laid eyes on it."</p>
<p>"It ain't yo' fault, Huck; you didn' know. &nbsp;Don't you blame
yo'self 'bout it."</p>
<p>When it was daylight, here was the clear Ohio water inshore,
sure enough, and outside was the old regular Muddy! &nbsp;So it was
all up with Cairo.</p>
<p>We talked it all over. &nbsp;It wouldn't do to take to the
shore; we couldn't take the raft up the stream, of course.
&nbsp;There warn't no way but to wait for dark, and start back in
the canoe and take the chances. &nbsp;So we slept all day amongst
the cottonwood thicket, so as to be fresh for the work, and when we
went back to the raft about dark the canoe was gone!</p>
<p>We didn't say a word for a good while. &nbsp;There warn't
anything to say. &nbsp;We both knowed well enough it was some more
work of the rattlesnake-skin; so what was the use to talk about it?
&nbsp;It would only look like we was finding fault, and that would
be bound to fetch more bad luck&mdash;and keep on fetching it, too,
till we knowed enough to keep still.</p>
<p>By and by we talked about what we better do, and found there
warn't no way but just to go along down with the raft till we got a
chance to buy a canoe to go back in. &nbsp;We warn't going to
borrow it when there warn't anybody around, the way pap would do,
for that might set people after us.</p>
<p>So we shoved out after dark on the raft.</p>
<p>Anybody that don't believe yet that it's foolishness to handle a
snake-skin, after all that that snake-skin done for us, will
believe it now if they read on and see what more it done for
us.</p>
<p>The place to buy canoes is off of rafts laying up at shore.
&nbsp;But we didn't see no rafts laying up; so we went along during
three hours and more. &nbsp;Well, the night got gray and ruther
thick, which is the next meanest thing to fog. &nbsp;You can't tell
the shape of the river, and you can't see no distance. It got to be
very late and still, and then along comes a steamboat up the river.
&nbsp;We lit the lantern, and judged she would see it.
&nbsp;Up-stream boats didn't generly come close to us; they go out
and follow the bars and hunt for easy water under the reefs; but
nights like this they bull right up the channel against the whole
river.</p>
<p>We could hear her pounding along, but we didn't see her good
till she was close. &nbsp;She aimed right for us. &nbsp;Often they
do that and try to see how close they can come without touching;
sometimes the wheel bites off a sweep, and then the pilot sticks
his head out and laughs, and thinks he's mighty smart. &nbsp;Well,
here she comes, and we said she was going to try and shave us; but
she didn't seem to be sheering off a bit. &nbsp;She was a big one,
and she was coming in a hurry, too, looking like a black cloud with
rows of glow-worms around it; but all of a sudden she bulged out,
big and scary, with a long row of wide-open furnace doors shining
like red-hot teeth, and her monstrous bows and guards hanging right
over us. &nbsp;There was a yell at us, and a jingling of bells to
stop the engines, a powwow of cussing, and whistling of
steam&mdash;and as Jim went overboard on one side and I on the
other, she come smashing straight through the raft.</p>
<p>I dived&mdash;and I aimed to find the bottom, too, for a
thirty-foot wheel had got to go over me, and I wanted it to have
plenty of room. &nbsp;I could always stay under water a minute;
this time I reckon I stayed under a minute and a half. &nbsp;Then I
bounced for the top in a hurry, for I was nearly busting. &nbsp;I
popped out to my armpits and blowed the water out of my nose, and
puffed a bit. &nbsp;Of course there was a booming current; and of
course that boat started her engines again ten seconds after she
stopped them, for they never cared much for raftsmen; so now she
was churning along up the river, out of sight in the thick weather,
though I could hear her.</p>
<p>I sung out for Jim about a dozen times, but I didn't get any
answer; so I grabbed a plank that touched me while I was "treading
water," and struck out for shore, shoving it ahead of me. &nbsp;But
I made out to see that the drift of the current was towards the
left-hand shore, which meant that I was in a crossing; so I changed
off and went that way.</p>
<p>It was one of these long, slanting, two-mile crossings; so I was
a good long time in getting over. &nbsp;I made a safe landing, and
clumb up the bank. I couldn't see but a little ways, but I went
poking along over rough ground for a quarter of a mile or more, and
then I run across a big old-fashioned double log-house before I
noticed it. &nbsp;I was going to rush by and get away, but a lot of
dogs jumped out and went to howling and barking at me, and I knowed
better than to move another peg.</p>

CHAPTER XVII.</p>
<p>IN about a minute somebody spoke out of a window without putting
his head out, and says:</p>
<p>"Be done, boys! &nbsp;Who's there?"</p>
<p>I says:</p>
<p>"It's me."</p>
<p>"Who's me?"</p>
<p>"George Jackson, sir."</p>
<p>"What do you want?"</p>
<p>"I don't want nothing, sir. &nbsp;I only want to go along by,
but the dogs won't let me."</p>
<p>"What are you prowling around here this time of night
for&mdash;hey?"</p>
<p>"I warn't prowling around, sir, I fell overboard off of the
steamboat."</p>
<p>"Oh, you did, did you? &nbsp;Strike a light there, somebody.
&nbsp;What did you say your name was?"</p>
<p>"George Jackson, sir. &nbsp;I'm only a boy."</p>
<p>"Look here, if you're telling the truth you needn't be
afraid&mdash;nobody'll hurt you. &nbsp;But don't try to budge;
stand right where you are. &nbsp;Rouse out Bob and Tom, some of
you, and fetch the guns. &nbsp;George Jackson, is there anybody
with you?"</p>
<p>"No, sir, nobody."</p>
<p>I heard the people stirring around in the house now, and see a
light. The man sung out:</p>
<p>"Snatch that light away, Betsy, you old fool&mdash;ain't you got
any sense? Put it on the floor behind the front door. &nbsp;Bob, if
you and Tom are ready, take your places."</p>
<p>"All ready."</p>
<p>"Now, George Jackson, do you know the Shepherdsons?"</p>
<p>"No, sir; I never heard of them."</p>
<p>"Well, that may be so, and it mayn't. &nbsp;Now, all ready.
&nbsp;Step forward, George Jackson. &nbsp;And mind, don't you
hurry&mdash;come mighty slow. &nbsp;If there's anybody with you,
let him keep back&mdash;if he shows himself he'll be shot. Come
along now. &nbsp;Come slow; push the door open yourself&mdash;just
enough to squeeze in, d' you hear?"</p>
<p>I didn't hurry; I couldn't if I'd a wanted to. &nbsp;I took one
slow step at a time and there warn't a sound, only I thought I
could hear my heart. &nbsp;The dogs were as still as the humans,
but they followed a little behind me. When I got to the three log
doorsteps I heard them unlocking and unbarring and unbolting.
&nbsp;I put my hand on the door and pushed it a little and a little
more till somebody said, "There, that's enough&mdash;put your head
in." I done it, but I judged they would take it off.</p>
<p>The candle was on the floor, and there they all was, looking at
me, and me at them, for about a quarter of a minute: &nbsp;Three
big men with guns pointed at me, which made me wince, I tell you;
the oldest, gray and about sixty, the other two thirty or
more&mdash;all of them fine and handsome&mdash;and the sweetest old
gray-headed lady, and back of her two young women which I couldn't
see right well. &nbsp;The old gentleman says:</p>
<p>"There; I reckon it's all right. &nbsp;Come in."</p>
<p>As soon as I was in the old gentleman he locked the door and
barred it and bolted it, and told the young men to come in with
their guns, and they all went in a big parlor that had a new rag
carpet on the floor, and got together in a corner that was out of
the range of the front windows&mdash;there warn't none on the side.
&nbsp;They held the candle, and took a good look at me, and all
said, "Why, HE ain't a Shepherdson&mdash;no, there ain't any
Shepherdson about him." &nbsp;Then the old man said he hoped I
wouldn't mind being searched for arms, because he didn't mean no
harm by it&mdash;it was only to make sure. &nbsp;So he didn't pry
into my pockets, but only felt outside with his hands, and said it
was all right. &nbsp;He told me to make myself easy and at home,
and tell all about myself; but the old lady says:</p>
<p>"Why, bless you, Saul, the poor thing's as wet as he can be; and
don't you reckon it may be he's hungry?"</p>
<p>"True for you, Rachel&mdash;I forgot."</p>
<p>So the old lady says:</p>
<p>"Betsy" (this was a nigger woman), "you fly around and get him
something to eat as quick as you can, poor thing; and one of you
girls go and wake up Buck and tell him&mdash;oh, here he is
himself. &nbsp;Buck, take this little stranger and get the wet
clothes off from him and dress him up in some of yours that's
dry."</p>
<p>Buck looked about as old as me&mdash;thirteen or fourteen or
along there, though he was a little bigger than me. &nbsp;He hadn't
on anything but a shirt, and he was very frowzy-headed. &nbsp;He
came in gaping and digging one fist into his eyes, and he was
dragging a gun along with the other one. He says:</p>

<br />
<br />
<br />
<p>"Ain't they no Shepherdsons around?"</p>
<p>They said, no, 'twas a false alarm.</p>
<p>"Well," he says, "if they'd a ben some, I reckon I'd a got
one."</p>
<p>They all laughed, and Bob says:</p>
<p>"Why, Buck, they might have scalped us all, you've been so slow
in coming."</p>
<p>"Well, nobody come after me, and it ain't right I'm always kept
down; I don't get no show."</p>
<p>"Never mind, Buck, my boy," says the old man, "you'll have show
enough, all in good time, don't you fret about that. &nbsp;Go 'long
with you now, and do as your mother told you."</p>
<p>When we got up-stairs to his room he got me a coarse shirt and a
roundabout and pants of his, and I put them on. &nbsp;While I was
at it he asked me what my name was, but before I could tell him he
started to tell me about a bluejay and a young rabbit he had
catched in the woods day before yesterday, and he asked me where
Moses was when the candle went out. &nbsp;I said I didn't know; I
hadn't heard about it before, no way.</p>
<p>"Well, guess," he says.</p>
<p>"How'm I going to guess," says I, "when I never heard tell of it
before?"</p>
<p>"But you can guess, can't you? &nbsp;It's just as easy."</p>
<p>"WHICH candle?" &nbsp;I says.</p>
<p>"Why, any candle," he says.</p>
<p>"I don't know where he was," says I; "where was he?"</p>
<p>"Why, he was in the DARK! &nbsp;That's where he was!"</p>
<p>"Well, if you knowed where he was, what did you ask me for?"</p>
<p>"Why, blame it, it's a riddle, don't you see? &nbsp;Say, how
long are you going to stay here? &nbsp;You got to stay always.
&nbsp;We can just have booming times&mdash;they don't have no
school now. &nbsp;Do you own a dog? &nbsp;I've got a dog&mdash;and
he'll go in the river and bring out chips that you throw in.
&nbsp;Do you like to comb up Sundays, and all that kind of
foolishness? &nbsp;You bet I don't, but ma she makes me.
&nbsp;Confound these ole britches! &nbsp;I reckon I'd better put
'em on, but I'd ruther not, it's so warm. &nbsp;Are you all ready?
All right. &nbsp;Come along, old hoss."</p>
<p>Cold corn-pone, cold corn-beef, butter and buttermilk&mdash;that
is what they had for me down there, and there ain't nothing better
that ever I've come across yet. &nbsp;Buck and his ma and all of
them smoked cob pipes, except the nigger woman, which was gone, and
the two young women. &nbsp;They all smoked and talked, and I eat
and talked. &nbsp;The young women had quilts around them, and their
hair down their backs. &nbsp;They all asked me questions, and I
told them how pap and me and all the family was living on a little
farm down at the bottom of Arkansaw, and my sister Mary Ann run off
and got married and never was heard of no more, and Bill went to
hunt them and he warn't heard of no more, and Tom and Mort died,
and then there warn't nobody but just me and pap left, and he was
just trimmed down to nothing, on account of his troubles; so when
he died I took what there was left, because the farm didn't belong
to us, and started up the river, deck passage, and fell overboard;
and that was how I come to be here. &nbsp;So they said I could have
a home there as long as I wanted it. &nbsp;Then it was most
daylight and everybody went to bed, and I went to bed with Buck,
and when I waked up in the morning, drat it all, I had forgot what
my name was. So I laid there about an hour trying to think, and
when Buck waked up I says:</p>
<p>"Can you spell, Buck?"</p>
<p>"Yes," he says.</p>
<p>"I bet you can't spell my name," says I.</p>
<p>"I bet you what you dare I can," says he.</p>
<p>"All right," says I, "go ahead."</p>
<p>"G-e-o-r-g-e J-a-x-o-n&mdash;there now," he says.</p>
<p>"Well," says I, "you done it, but I didn't think you could.
&nbsp;It ain't no slouch of a name to spell&mdash;right off without
studying."</p>
<p>I set it down, private, because somebody might want ME to spell
it next, and so I wanted to be handy with it and rattle it off like
I was used to it.</p>
<p>It was a mighty nice family, and a mighty nice house, too.
&nbsp;I hadn't seen no house out in the country before that was so
nice and had so much style. &nbsp;It didn't have an iron latch on
the front door, nor a wooden one with a buckskin string, but a
brass knob to turn, the same as houses in town. There warn't no bed
in the parlor, nor a sign of a bed; but heaps of parlors in towns
has beds in them. &nbsp;There was a big fireplace that was bricked
on the bottom, and the bricks was kept clean and red by pouring
water on them and scrubbing them with another brick; sometimes they
wash them over with red water-paint that they call Spanish-brown,
same as they do in town. &nbsp;They had big brass dog-irons that
could hold up a saw-log. There was a clock on the middle of the
mantelpiece, with a picture of a town painted on the bottom half of
the glass front, and a round place in the middle of it for the sun,
and you could see the pendulum swinging behind it. &nbsp;It was
beautiful to hear that clock tick; and sometimes when one of these
peddlers had been along and scoured her up and got her in good
shape, she would start in and strike a hundred and fifty before she
got tuckered out. &nbsp;They wouldn't took any money for her.</p>
<p>Well, there was a big outlandish parrot on each side of the
clock, made out of something like chalk, and painted up gaudy.
&nbsp;By one of the parrots was a cat made of crockery, and a
crockery dog by the other; and when you pressed down on them they
squeaked, but didn't open their mouths nor look different nor
interested. &nbsp;They squeaked through underneath. &nbsp;There was
a couple of big wild-turkey-wing fans spread out behind those
things. &nbsp;On the table in the middle of the room was a kind of
a lovely crockery basket that had apples and oranges and peaches
and grapes piled up in it, which was much redder and yellower and
prettier than real ones is, but they warn't real because you could
see where pieces had got chipped off and showed the white chalk, or
whatever it was, underneath.</p>
<p>This table had a cover made out of beautiful oilcloth, with a
red and blue spread-eagle painted on it, and a painted border all
around. &nbsp;It come all the way from Philadelphia, they said.
&nbsp;There was some books, too, piled up perfectly exact, on each
corner of the table. &nbsp;One was a big family Bible full of
pictures. &nbsp;One was Pilgrim's Progress, about a man that left
his family, it didn't say why. &nbsp;I read considerable in it now
and then. &nbsp;The statements was interesting, but tough.
&nbsp;Another was Friendship's Offering, full of beautiful stuff
and poetry; but I didn't read the poetry. &nbsp;Another was Henry
Clay's Speeches, and another was Dr. Gunn's Family Medicine, which
told you all about what to do if a body was sick or dead.
&nbsp;There was a hymn book, and a lot of other books. &nbsp;And
there was nice split-bottom chairs, and perfectly sound,
too&mdash;not bagged down in the middle and busted, like an old
basket.</p>
<p>They had pictures hung on the walls&mdash;mainly Washingtons and
Lafayettes, and battles, and Highland Marys, and one called
"Signing the Declaration." There was some that they called crayons,
which one of the daughters which was dead made her own self when
she was only fifteen years old. &nbsp;They was different from any
pictures I ever see before&mdash;blacker, mostly, than is common.
&nbsp;One was a woman in a slim black dress, belted small under the
armpits, with bulges like a cabbage in the middle of the sleeves,
and a large black scoop-shovel bonnet with a black veil, and white
slim ankles crossed about with black tape, and very wee black
slippers, like a chisel, and she was leaning pensive on a tombstone
on her right elbow, under a weeping willow, and her other hand
hanging down her side holding a white handkerchief and a reticule,
and underneath the picture it said "Shall I Never See Thee More
Alas." &nbsp;Another one was a young lady with her hair all combed
up straight to the top of her head, and knotted there in front of a
comb like a chair-back, and she was crying into a handkerchief and
had a dead bird laying on its back in her other hand with its heels
up, and underneath the picture it said "I Shall Never Hear Thy
Sweet Chirrup More Alas." &nbsp;There was one where a young lady
was at a window looking up at the moon, and tears running down her
cheeks; and she had an open letter in one hand with black sealing
wax showing on one edge of it, and she was mashing a locket with a
chain to it against her mouth, and underneath the picture it said
"And Art Thou Gone Yes Thou Art Gone Alas." &nbsp;These was all
nice pictures, I reckon, but I didn't somehow seem to take to them,
because if ever I was down a little they always give me the
fan-tods. &nbsp;Everybody was sorry she died, because she had laid
out a lot more of these pictures to do, and a body could see by
what she had done what they had lost. &nbsp;But I reckoned that
with her disposition she was having a better time in the graveyard.
&nbsp;She was at work on what they said was her greatest picture
when she took sick, and every day and every night it was her prayer
to be allowed to live till she got it done, but she never got the
chance. &nbsp;It was a picture of a young woman in a long white
gown, standing on the rail of a bridge all ready to jump off, with
her hair all down her back, and looking up to the moon, with the
tears running down her face, and she had two arms folded across her
breast, and two arms stretched out in front, and two more reaching
up towards the moon&mdash;and the idea was to see which pair would
look best, and then scratch out all the other arms; but, as I was
saying, she died before she got her mind made up, and now they kept
this picture over the head of the bed in her room, and every time
her birthday come they hung flowers on it. &nbsp;Other times it was
hid with a little curtain. &nbsp;The young woman in the picture had
a kind of a nice sweet face, but there was so many arms it made her
look too spidery, seemed to me.</p>

<p>This young girl kept a scrap-book when she was alive, and used
to paste obituaries and accidents and cases of patient suffering in
it out of the Presbyterian Observer, and write poetry after them
out of her own head. It was very good poetry. This is what she
wrote about a boy by the name of Stephen Dowling Bots that fell
down a well and was drownded:</p>
<p>ODE TO STEPHEN DOWLING BOTS, DEC'D</p>
<div class="poem">
<p style="text-indent:0%;">And did young Stephen sicken,<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp;And did young Stephen die?<br />
And did the sad hearts thicken,<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp;And did the mourners cry?<br />
<br />
No; such was not the fate of<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp;Young Stephen Dowling Bots;<br />
Though sad hearts round him thickened,<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp;'Twas not from sickness' shots.<br />
<br />
No whooping-cough did rack his frame,<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp;Nor measles drear with spots;<br />
Not these impaired the sacred name<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp;Of Stephen Dowling Bots.<br />
<br />
Despised love struck not with woe<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp;That head of curly knots,<br />
Nor stomach troubles laid him low,<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp;Young Stephen Dowling Bots.<br />
<br />
O no. Then list with tearful eye,<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp;Whilst I his fate do tell.<br />
His soul did from this cold world fly<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp;By falling down a well.<br />
<br />
They got him out and emptied him;<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp;Alas it was too late;<br />
His spirit was gone for to sport aloft<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp;In the realms of the good and great.<br /></p>
</div>
<p>If Emmeline Grangerford could make poetry like that before she
was fourteen, there ain't no telling what she could a done by and
by. &nbsp;Buck said she could rattle off poetry like nothing.
&nbsp;She didn't ever have to stop to think. &nbsp;He said she
would slap down a line, and if she couldn't find anything to rhyme
with it would just scratch it out and slap down another one, and go
ahead. She warn't particular; she could write about anything you
choose to give her to write about just so it was sadful. Every time
a man died, or a woman died, or a child died, she would be on hand
with her "tribute" before he was cold. &nbsp;She called them
tributes. The neighbors said it was the doctor first, then
Emmeline, then the undertaker&mdash;the undertaker never got in
ahead of Emmeline but once, and then she hung fire on a rhyme for
the dead person's name, which was Whistler. &nbsp;She warn't ever
the same after that; she never complained, but she kinder pined
away and did not live long. &nbsp;Poor thing, many's the time I
made myself go up to the little room that used to be hers and get
out her poor old scrap-book and read in it when her pictures had
been aggravating me and I had soured on her a little. &nbsp;I liked
all that family, dead ones and all, and warn't going to let
anything come between us. &nbsp;Poor Emmeline made poetry about all
the dead people when she was alive, and it didn't seem right that
there warn't nobody to make some about her now she was gone; so I
tried to sweat out a verse or two myself, but I couldn't seem to
make it go somehow. &nbsp;They kept Emmeline's room trim and nice,
and all the things fixed in it just the way she liked to have them
when she was alive, and nobody ever slept there. &nbsp;The old lady
took care of the room herself, though there was plenty of niggers,
and she sewed there a good deal and read her Bible there
mostly.</p>
<p>Well, as I was saying about the parlor, there was beautiful
curtains on the windows: &nbsp;white, with pictures painted on them
of castles with vines all down the walls, and cattle coming down to
drink. &nbsp;There was a little old piano, too, that had tin pans
in it, I reckon, and nothing was ever so lovely as to hear the
young ladies sing "The Last Link is Broken" and play "The Battle of
Prague" on it. &nbsp;The walls of all the rooms was plastered, and
most had carpets on the floors, and the whole house was whitewashed
on the outside.</p>
<p>It was a double house, and the big open place betwixt them was
roofed and floored, and sometimes the table was set there in the
middle of the day, and it was a cool, comfortable place.
&nbsp;Nothing couldn't be better. &nbsp;And warn't the cooking
good, and just bushels of it too!</p>

CHAPTER XVIII.</p>
<p>COL. &nbsp;GRANGERFORD was a gentleman, you see. &nbsp;He was a
gentleman all over; and so was his family. &nbsp;He was well born,
as the saying is, and that's worth as much in a man as it is in a
horse, so the Widow Douglas said, and nobody ever denied that she
was of the first aristocracy in our town; and pap he always said
it, too, though he warn't no more quality than a mudcat himself.
&nbsp;Col. &nbsp;Grangerford was very tall and very slim, and had a
darkish-paly complexion, not a sign of red in it anywheres; he was
clean shaved every morning all over his thin face, and he had the
thinnest kind of lips, and the thinnest kind of nostrils, and a
high nose, and heavy eyebrows, and the blackest kind of eyes, sunk
so deep back that they seemed like they was looking out of caverns
at you, as you may say. &nbsp;His forehead was high, and his hair
was black and straight and hung to his shoulders. His hands was
long and thin, and every day of his life he put on a clean shirt
and a full suit from head to foot made out of linen so white it
hurt your eyes to look at it; and on Sundays he wore a blue
tail-coat with brass buttons on it. &nbsp;He carried a mahogany
cane with a silver head to it. &nbsp;There warn't no frivolishness
about him, not a bit, and he warn't ever loud. &nbsp;He was as kind
as he could be&mdash;you could feel that, you know, and so you had
confidence. &nbsp;Sometimes he smiled, and it was good to see; but
when he straightened himself up like a liberty-pole, and the
lightning begun to flicker out from under his eyebrows, you wanted
to climb a tree first, and find out what the matter was afterwards.
&nbsp;He didn't ever have to tell anybody to mind their
manners&mdash;everybody was always good-mannered where he was.
&nbsp;Everybody loved to have him around, too; he was sunshine most
always&mdash;I mean he made it seem like good weather. &nbsp;When
he turned into a cloudbank it was awful dark for half a minute, and
that was enough; there wouldn't nothing go wrong again for a
week.</p>
<p>When him and the old lady come down in the morning all the
family got up out of their chairs and give them good-day, and
didn't set down again till they had set down. &nbsp;Then Tom and
Bob went to the sideboard where the decanter was, and mixed a glass
of bitters and handed it to him, and he held it in his hand and
waited till Tom's and Bob's was mixed, and then they bowed and
said, "Our duty to you, sir, and madam;" and THEY bowed the least
bit in the world and said thank you, and so they drank, all three,
and Bob and Tom poured a spoonful of water on the sugar and the
mite of whisky or apple brandy in the bottom of their tumblers, and
give it to me and Buck, and we drank to the old people too.</p>
<p>Bob was the oldest and Tom next&mdash;tall, beautiful men with
very broad shoulders and brown faces, and long black hair and black
eyes. &nbsp;They dressed in white linen from head to foot, like the
old gentleman, and wore broad Panama hats.</p>
<p>Then there was Miss Charlotte; she was twenty-five, and tall and
proud and grand, but as good as she could be when she warn't
stirred up; but when she was she had a look that would make you
wilt in your tracks, like her father. &nbsp;She was beautiful.</p>
<p>So was her sister, Miss Sophia, but it was a different kind.
&nbsp;She was gentle and sweet like a dove, and she was only
twenty.</p>
<p>Each person had their own nigger to wait on them&mdash;Buck too.
&nbsp;My nigger had a monstrous easy time, because I warn't used to
having anybody do anything for me, but Buck's was on the jump most
of the time.</p>
<p>This was all there was of the family now, but there used to be
more&mdash;three sons; they got killed; and Emmeline that died.</p>
<p>The old gentleman owned a lot of farms and over a hundred
niggers. Sometimes a stack of people would come there, horseback,
from ten or fifteen mile around, and stay five or six days, and
have such junketings round about and on the river, and dances and
picnics in the woods daytimes, and balls at the house nights.
&nbsp;These people was mostly kinfolks of the family. &nbsp;The men
brought their guns with them. &nbsp;It was a handsome lot of
quality, I tell you.</p>
<p>There was another clan of aristocracy around there&mdash;five or
six families&mdash;mostly of the name of Shepherdson. &nbsp;They
was as high-toned and well born and rich and grand as the tribe of
Grangerfords. &nbsp;The Shepherdsons and Grangerfords used the same
steamboat landing, which was about two mile above our house; so
sometimes when I went up there with a lot of our folks I used to
see a lot of the Shepherdsons there on their fine horses.</p>
<p>One day Buck and me was away out in the woods hunting, and heard
a horse coming. &nbsp;We was crossing the road. &nbsp;Buck
says:</p>
<p>"Quick! &nbsp;Jump for the woods!"</p>
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<a name="c18-145" id="c18-145"></a><br />
<br />

width="443" /><br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<p>We done it, and then peeped down the woods through the leaves.
&nbsp;Pretty soon a splendid young man come galloping down the
road, setting his horse easy and looking like a soldier. &nbsp;He
had his gun across his pommel. &nbsp;I had seen him before.
&nbsp;It was young Harney Shepherdson. &nbsp;I heard Buck's gun go
off at my ear, and Harney's hat tumbled off from his head. &nbsp;He
grabbed his gun and rode straight to the place where we was hid.
&nbsp;But we didn't wait. &nbsp;We started through the woods on a
run. &nbsp;The woods warn't thick, so I looked over my shoulder to
dodge the bullet, and twice I seen Harney cover Buck with his gun;
and then he rode away the way he come&mdash;to get his hat, I
reckon, but I couldn't see. &nbsp;We never stopped running till we
got home. &nbsp;The old gentleman's eyes blazed a
minute&mdash;'twas pleasure, mainly, I judged&mdash;then his face
sort of smoothed down, and he says, kind of gentle:</p>
<p>"I don't like that shooting from behind a bush. &nbsp;Why didn't
you step into the road, my boy?"</p>
<p>"The Shepherdsons don't, father. &nbsp;They always take
advantage."</p>
<p>Miss Charlotte she held her head up like a queen while Buck was
telling his tale, and her nostrils spread and her eyes snapped.
&nbsp;The two young men looked dark, but never said nothing.
&nbsp;Miss Sophia she turned pale, but the color come back when she
found the man warn't hurt.</p>

<br />
<br />
<br />
<p>Soon as I could get Buck down by the corn-cribs under the trees
by ourselves, I says:</p>
<p>"Did you want to kill him, Buck?"</p>
<p>"Well, I bet I did."</p>
<p>"What did he do to you?"</p>
<p>"Him? &nbsp;He never done nothing to me."</p>
<p>"Well, then, what did you want to kill him for?"</p>
<p>"Why, nothing&mdash;only it's on account of the feud."</p>
<p>"What's a feud?"</p>
<p>"Why, where was you raised? &nbsp;Don't you know what a feud
is?"</p>
<p>"Never heard of it before&mdash;tell me about it."</p>
<p>"Well," says Buck, "a feud is this way: &nbsp;A man has a
quarrel with another man, and kills him; then that other man's
brother kills HIM; then the other brothers, on both sides, goes for
one another; then the COUSINS chip in&mdash;and by and by
everybody's killed off, and there ain't no more feud. &nbsp;But
it's kind of slow, and takes a long time."</p>
<p>"Has this one been going on long, Buck?"</p>
<p>"Well, I should RECKON! &nbsp;It started thirty year ago, or
som'ers along there. &nbsp;There was trouble 'bout something, and
then a lawsuit to settle it; and the suit went agin one of the men,
and so he up and shot the man that won the suit&mdash;which he
would naturally do, of course. &nbsp;Anybody would."</p>
<p>"What was the trouble about, Buck?&mdash;land?"</p>
<p>"I reckon maybe&mdash;I don't know."</p>
<p>"Well, who done the shooting? &nbsp;Was it a Grangerford or a
Shepherdson?"</p>
<p>"Laws, how do I know? &nbsp;It was so long ago."</p>
<p>"Don't anybody know?"</p>
<p>"Oh, yes, pa knows, I reckon, and some of the other old people;
but they don't know now what the row was about in the first
place."</p>
<p>"Has there been many killed, Buck?"</p>
<p>"Yes; right smart chance of funerals. &nbsp;But they don't
always kill. &nbsp;Pa's got a few buckshot in him; but he don't
mind it 'cuz he don't weigh much, anyway. &nbsp;Bob's been carved
up some with a bowie, and Tom's been hurt once or twice."</p>
<p>"Has anybody been killed this year, Buck?"</p>
<p>"Yes; we got one and they got one. &nbsp;'Bout three months ago
my cousin Bud, fourteen year old, was riding through the woods on
t'other side of the river, and didn't have no weapon with him,
which was blame' foolishness, and in a lonesome place he hears a
horse a-coming behind him, and sees old Baldy Shepherdson a-linkin'
after him with his gun in his hand and his white hair a-flying in
the wind; and 'stead of jumping off and taking to the brush, Bud
'lowed he could out-run him; so they had it, nip and tuck, for five
mile or more, the old man a-gaining all the time; so at last Bud
seen it warn't any use, so he stopped and faced around so as to
have the bullet holes in front, you know, and the old man he rode
up and shot him down. &nbsp;But he didn't git much chance to enjoy
his luck, for inside of a week our folks laid HIM out."</p>
<p>"I reckon that old man was a coward, Buck."</p>
<p>"I reckon he WARN'T a coward. &nbsp;Not by a blame' sight.
&nbsp;There ain't a coward amongst them Shepherdsons&mdash;not a
one. &nbsp;And there ain't no cowards amongst the Grangerfords
either. &nbsp;Why, that old man kep' up his end in a fight one day
for half an hour against three Grangerfords, and come out winner.
&nbsp;They was all a-horseback; he lit off of his horse and got
behind a little woodpile, and kep' his horse before him to stop the
bullets; but the Grangerfords stayed on their horses and capered
around the old man, and peppered away at him, and he peppered away
at them. &nbsp;Him and his horse both went home pretty leaky and
crippled, but the Grangerfords had to be FETCHED home&mdash;and one
of 'em was dead, and another died the next day. &nbsp;No, sir; if a
body's out hunting for cowards he don't want to fool away any time
amongst them Shepherdsons, becuz they don't breed any of that
KIND."</p>
<p>Next Sunday we all went to church, about three mile, everybody
a-horseback. The men took their guns along, so did Buck, and kept
them between their knees or stood them handy against the wall.
&nbsp;The Shepherdsons done the same. &nbsp;It was pretty ornery
preaching&mdash;all about brotherly love, and such-like
tiresomeness; but everybody said it was a good sermon, and they all
talked it over going home, and had such a powerful lot to say about
faith and good works and free grace and preforeordestination, and I
don't know what all, that it did seem to me to be one of the
roughest Sundays I had run across yet.</p>
<p>About an hour after dinner everybody was dozing around, some in
their chairs and some in their rooms, and it got to be pretty dull.
&nbsp;Buck and a dog was stretched out on the grass in the sun
sound asleep. &nbsp;I went up to our room, and judged I would take
a nap myself. &nbsp;I found that sweet Miss Sophia standing in her
door, which was next to ours, and she took me in her room and shut
the door very soft, and asked me if I liked her, and I said I did;
and she asked me if I would do something for her and not tell
anybody, and I said I would. &nbsp;Then she said she'd forgot her
Testament, and left it in the seat at church between two other
books, and would I slip out quiet and go there and fetch it to her,
and not say nothing to nobody. &nbsp;I said I would. So I slid out
and slipped off up the road, and there warn't anybody at the
church, except maybe a hog or two, for there warn't any lock on the
door, and hogs likes a puncheon floor in summer-time because it's
cool. &nbsp;If you notice, most folks don't go to church only when
they've got to; but a hog is different.</p>

<br />
<br />
<br />
<p>Says I to myself, something's up; it ain't natural for a girl to
be in such a sweat about a Testament. &nbsp;So I give it a shake,
and out drops a little piece of paper with "HALF-PAST TWO" wrote on
it with a pencil. &nbsp;I ransacked it, but couldn't find anything
else. &nbsp;I couldn't make anything out of that, so I put the
paper in the book again, and when I got home and upstairs there was
Miss Sophia in her door waiting for me. &nbsp;She pulled me in and
shut the door; then she looked in the Testament till she found the
paper, and as soon as she read it she looked glad; and before a
body could think she grabbed me and give me a squeeze, and said I
was the best boy in the world, and not to tell anybody. &nbsp;She
was mighty red in the face for a minute, and her eyes lighted up,
and it made her powerful pretty. &nbsp;I was a good deal
astonished, but when I got my breath I asked her what the paper was
about, and she asked me if I had read it, and I said no, and she
asked me if I could read writing, and I told her "no, only
coarse-hand," and then she said the paper warn't anything but a
book-mark to keep her place, and I might go and play now.</p>
<p>I went off down to the river, studying over this thing, and
pretty soon I noticed that my nigger was following along behind.
&nbsp;When we was out of sight of the house he looked back and
around a second, and then comes a-running, and says:</p>
<p>"Mars Jawge, if you'll come down into de swamp I'll show you a
whole stack o' water-moccasins."</p>
<p>Thinks I, that's mighty curious; he said that yesterday.
&nbsp;He oughter know a body don't love water-moccasins enough to
go around hunting for them. What is he up to, anyway? &nbsp;So I
says:</p>
<p>"All right; trot ahead."</p>
<p>I followed a half a mile; then he struck out over the swamp, and
waded ankle deep as much as another half-mile. &nbsp;We come to a
little flat piece of land which was dry and very thick with trees
and bushes and vines, and he says:</p>
<p>"You shove right in dah jist a few steps, Mars Jawge; dah's whah
dey is. I's seed 'm befo'; I don't k'yer to see 'em no mo'."</p>
<p>Then he slopped right along and went away, and pretty soon the
trees hid him. &nbsp;I poked into the place a-ways and come to a
little open patch as big as a bedroom all hung around with vines,
and found a man laying there asleep&mdash;and, by jings, it was my
old Jim!</p>
<p>I waked him up, and I reckoned it was going to be a grand
surprise to him to see me again, but it warn't. &nbsp;He nearly
cried he was so glad, but he warn't surprised. &nbsp;Said he swum
along behind me that night, and heard me yell every time, but
dasn't answer, because he didn't want nobody to pick HIM up and
take him into slavery again. &nbsp;Says he:</p>
<p>"I got hurt a little, en couldn't swim fas', so I wuz a
considable ways behine you towards de las'; when you landed I
reck'ned I could ketch up wid you on de lan' 'dout havin' to shout
at you, but when I see dat house I begin to go slow. &nbsp;I 'uz
off too fur to hear what dey say to you&mdash;I wuz 'fraid o' de
dogs; but when it 'uz all quiet agin I knowed you's in de house, so
I struck out for de woods to wait for day. &nbsp;Early in de
mawnin' some er de niggers come along, gwyne to de fields, en dey
tuk me en showed me dis place, whah de dogs can't track me on
accounts o' de water, en dey brings me truck to eat every night, en
tells me how you's a-gitt'n along."</p>
<p>"Why didn't you tell my Jack to fetch me here sooner, Jim?"</p>
<p>"Well, 'twarn't no use to 'sturb you, Huck, tell we could do
sumfn&mdash;but we's all right now. &nbsp;I ben a-buyin' pots en
pans en vittles, as I got a chanst, en a-patchin' up de raf' nights
when&mdash;"</p>
<p>"WHAT raft, Jim?"</p>
<p>"Our ole raf'."</p>
<p>"You mean to say our old raft warn't smashed all to
flinders?"</p>
<p>"No, she warn't. &nbsp;She was tore up a good deal&mdash;one en'
of her was; but dey warn't no great harm done, on'y our traps was
mos' all los'. &nbsp;Ef we hadn' dive' so deep en swum so fur under
water, en de night hadn' ben so dark, en we warn't so sk'yerd, en
ben sich punkin-heads, as de sayin' is, we'd a seed de raf'.
&nbsp;But it's jis' as well we didn't, 'kase now she's all fixed up
agin mos' as good as new, en we's got a new lot o' stuff, in de
place o' what 'uz los'."</p>
<p>"Why, how did you get hold of the raft again, Jim&mdash;did you
catch her?"</p>
<p>"How I gwyne to ketch her en I out in de woods? &nbsp;No; some
er de niggers foun' her ketched on a snag along heah in de ben', en
dey hid her in a crick 'mongst de willows, en dey wuz so much
jawin' 'bout which un 'um she b'long to de mos' dat I come to heah
'bout it pooty soon, so I ups en settles de trouble by tellin' 'um
she don't b'long to none uv um, but to you en me; en I ast 'm if
dey gwyne to grab a young white genlman's propaty, en git a hid'n
for it? &nbsp;Den I gin 'm ten cents apiece, en dey 'uz mighty well
satisfied, en wisht some mo' raf's 'ud come along en make 'm rich
agin. Dey's mighty good to me, dese niggers is, en whatever I wants
'm to do fur me I doan' have to ast 'm twice, honey. &nbsp;Dat
Jack's a good nigger, en pooty smart."</p>
<p>"Yes, he is. &nbsp;He ain't ever told me you was here; told me
to come, and he'd show me a lot of water-moccasins. &nbsp;If
anything happens HE ain't mixed up in it. &nbsp;He can say he never
seen us together, and it 'll be the truth."</p>
<p>I don't want to talk much about the next day. &nbsp;I reckon
I'll cut it pretty short. &nbsp;I waked up about dawn, and was
a-going to turn over and go to sleep again when I noticed how still
it was&mdash;didn't seem to be anybody stirring. &nbsp;That warn't
usual. &nbsp;Next I noticed that Buck was up and gone. Well, I gets
up, a-wondering, and goes down stairs&mdash;nobody around;
everything as still as a mouse. &nbsp;Just the same outside.
&nbsp;Thinks I, what does it mean? &nbsp;Down by the wood-pile I
comes across my Jack, and says:</p>
<p>"What's it all about?"</p>
<p>Says he:</p>
<p>"Don't you know, Mars Jawge?"</p>
<p>"No," says I, "I don't."</p>
<p>"Well, den, Miss Sophia's run off! 'deed she has. &nbsp;She run
off in de night some time&mdash;nobody don't know jis' when; run
off to get married to dat young Harney Shepherdson, you
know&mdash;leastways, so dey 'spec. &nbsp;De fambly foun' it out
'bout half an hour ago&mdash;maybe a little mo'&mdash;en' I TELL
you dey warn't no time los'. &nbsp;Sich another hurryin' up guns en
hosses YOU never see! &nbsp;De women folks has gone for to stir up
de relations, en ole Mars Saul en de boys tuck dey guns en rode up
de river road for to try to ketch dat young man en kill him 'fo' he
kin git acrost de river wid Miss Sophia. &nbsp;I reck'n dey's gwyne
to be mighty rough times."</p>
<p>"Buck went off 'thout waking me up."</p>
<p>"Well, I reck'n he DID! &nbsp;Dey warn't gwyne to mix you up in
it. &nbsp;Mars Buck he loaded up his gun en 'lowed he's gwyne to
fetch home a Shepherdson or bust. Well, dey'll be plenty un 'm dah,
I reck'n, en you bet you he'll fetch one ef he gits a chanst."</p>
<p>I took up the river road as hard as I could put. &nbsp;By and by
I begin to hear guns a good ways off. &nbsp;When I come in sight of
the log store and the woodpile where the steamboats lands I worked
along under the trees and brush till I got to a good place, and
then I clumb up into the forks of a cottonwood that was out of
reach, and watched. &nbsp;There was a wood-rank four foot high a
little ways in front of the tree, and first I was going to hide
behind that; but maybe it was luckier I didn't.</p>
<p>There was four or five men cavorting around on their horses in
the open place before the log store, cussing and yelling, and
trying to get at a couple of young chaps that was behind the
wood-rank alongside of the steamboat landing; but they couldn't
come it. &nbsp;Every time one of them showed himself on the river
side of the woodpile he got shot at. &nbsp;The two boys was
squatting back to back behind the pile, so they could watch both
ways.</p>

width="643" /><br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<p>By and by the men stopped cavorting around and yelling.
&nbsp;They started riding towards the store; then up gets one of
the boys, draws a steady bead over the wood-rank, and drops one of
them out of his saddle. &nbsp;All the men jumped off of their
horses and grabbed the hurt one and started to carry him to the
store; and that minute the two boys started on the run. &nbsp;They
got half way to the tree I was in before the men noticed. Then the
men see them, and jumped on their horses and took out after them.
&nbsp;They gained on the boys, but it didn't do no good, the boys
had too good a start; they got to the woodpile that was in front of
my tree, and slipped in behind it, and so they had the bulge on the
men again. One of the boys was Buck, and the other was a slim young
chap about nineteen years old.</p>
<p>The men ripped around awhile, and then rode away. &nbsp;As soon
as they was out of sight I sung out to Buck and told him. &nbsp;He
didn't know what to make of my voice coming out of the tree at
first. &nbsp;He was awful surprised. &nbsp;He told me to watch out
sharp and let him know when the men come in sight again; said they
was up to some devilment or other&mdash;wouldn't be gone long.
&nbsp;I wished I was out of that tree, but I dasn't come down.
&nbsp;Buck begun to cry and rip, and 'lowed that him and his cousin
Joe (that was the other young chap) would make up for this day yet.
&nbsp;He said his father and his two brothers was killed, and two
or three of the enemy. &nbsp;Said the Shepherdsons laid for them in
ambush. &nbsp;Buck said his father and brothers ought to waited for
their relations&mdash;the Shepherdsons was too strong for them.
&nbsp;I asked him what was become of young Harney and Miss Sophia.
&nbsp;He said they'd got across the river and was safe. &nbsp;I was
glad of that; but the way Buck did take on because he didn't manage
to kill Harney that day he shot at him&mdash;I hain't ever heard
anything like it.</p>
<p>All of a sudden, bang! bang! bang! goes three or four
guns&mdash;the men had slipped around through the woods and come in
from behind without their horses! &nbsp;The boys jumped for the
river&mdash;both of them hurt&mdash;and as they swum down the
current the men run along the bank shooting at them and singing
out, "Kill them, kill them!" &nbsp;It made me so sick I most fell
out of the tree. &nbsp;I ain't a-going to tell ALL that
happened&mdash;it would make me sick again if I was to do that.
&nbsp;I wished I hadn't ever come ashore that night to see such
things. &nbsp;I ain't ever going to get shut of them&mdash;lots of
times I dream about them.</p>
<p>I stayed in the tree till it begun to get dark, afraid to come
down. Sometimes I heard guns away off in the woods; and twice I
seen little gangs of men gallop past the log store with guns; so I
reckoned the trouble was still a-going on. &nbsp;I was mighty
downhearted; so I made up my mind I wouldn't ever go anear that
house again, because I reckoned I was to blame, somehow. I judged
that that piece of paper meant that Miss Sophia was to meet Harney
somewheres at half-past two and run off; and I judged I ought to
told her father about that paper and the curious way she acted, and
then maybe he would a locked her up, and this awful mess wouldn't
ever happened.</p>
<p>When I got down out of the tree I crept along down the river
bank a piece, and found the two bodies laying in the edge of the
water, and tugged at them till I got them ashore; then I covered up
their faces, and got away as quick as I could. &nbsp;I cried a
little when I was covering up Buck's face, for he was mighty good
to me.</p>
<p>It was just dark now. &nbsp;I never went near the house, but
struck through the woods and made for the swamp. &nbsp;Jim warn't
on his island, so I tramped off in a hurry for the crick, and
crowded through the willows, red-hot to jump aboard and get out of
that awful country. &nbsp;The raft was gone! &nbsp;My souls, but I
was scared! &nbsp;I couldn't get my breath for most a minute. Then
I raised a yell. &nbsp;A voice not twenty-five foot from me
says:</p>
<p>"Good lan'! is dat you, honey? &nbsp;Doan' make no noise."</p>
<p>It was Jim's voice&mdash;nothing ever sounded so good before.
&nbsp;I run along the bank a piece and got aboard, and Jim he
grabbed me and hugged me, he was so glad to see me. &nbsp;He
says:</p>
<p>"Laws bless you, chile, I 'uz right down sho' you's dead agin.
&nbsp;Jack's been heah; he say he reck'n you's ben shot, kase you
didn' come home no mo'; so I's jes' dis minute a startin' de raf'
down towards de mouf er de crick, so's to be all ready for to shove
out en leave soon as Jack comes agin en tells me for certain you IS
dead. &nbsp;Lawsy, I's mighty glad to git you back again,
honey."</p>
<p>I says:</p>
<p>"All right&mdash;that's mighty good; they won't find me, and
they'll think I've been killed, and floated down the
river&mdash;there's something up there that 'll help them think
so&mdash;so don't you lose no time, Jim, but just shove off for the
big water as fast as ever you can."</p>
<p>I never felt easy till the raft was two mile below there and out
in the middle of the Mississippi. &nbsp;Then we hung up our signal
lantern, and judged that we was free and safe once more. &nbsp;I
hadn't had a bite to eat since yesterday, so Jim he got out some
corn-dodgers and buttermilk, and pork and cabbage and
greens&mdash;there ain't nothing in the world so good when it's
cooked right&mdash;and whilst I eat my supper we talked and had a
good time. &nbsp;I was powerful glad to get away from the feuds,
and so was Jim to get away from the swamp. &nbsp;We said there
warn't no home like a raft, after all. &nbsp;Other places do seem
so cramped up and smothery, but a raft don't. &nbsp;You feel mighty
free and easy and comfortable on a raft.</p>

CHAPTER XIX.</p>
<p>TWO or three days and nights went by; I reckon I might say they
swum by, they slid along so quiet and smooth and lovely. &nbsp;Here
is the way we put in the time. &nbsp;It was a monstrous big river
down there&mdash;sometimes a mile and a half wide; we run nights,
and laid up and hid daytimes; soon as night was most gone we
stopped navigating and tied up&mdash;nearly always in the dead
water under a towhead; and then cut young cottonwoods and willows,
and hid the raft with them. &nbsp;Then we set out the lines.
&nbsp;Next we slid into the river and had a swim, so as to freshen
up and cool off; then we set down on the sandy bottom where the
water was about knee deep, and watched the daylight come. &nbsp;Not
a sound anywheres&mdash;perfectly still&mdash;just like the whole
world was asleep, only sometimes the bullfrogs a-cluttering, maybe.
&nbsp;The first thing to see, looking away over the water, was a
kind of dull line&mdash;that was the woods on t'other side; you
couldn't make nothing else out; then a pale place in the sky; then
more paleness spreading around; then the river softened up away
off, and warn't black any more, but gray; you could see little dark
spots drifting along ever so far away&mdash;trading scows, and such
things; and long black streaks&mdash;rafts; sometimes you could
hear a sweep screaking; or jumbled up voices, it was so still, and
sounds come so far; and by and by you could see a streak on the
water which you know by the look of the streak that there's a snag
there in a swift current which breaks on it and makes that streak
look that way; and you see the mist curl up off of the water, and
the east reddens up, and the river, and you make out a log-cabin in
the edge of the woods, away on the bank on t'other side of the
river, being a woodyard, likely, and piled by them cheats so you
can throw a dog through it anywheres; then the nice breeze springs
up, and comes fanning you from over there, so cool and fresh and
sweet to smell on account of the woods and the flowers; but
sometimes not that way, because they've left dead fish laying
around, gars and such, and they do get pretty rank; and next you've
got the full day, and everything smiling in the sun, and the
song-birds just going it!</p>
<p>A little smoke couldn't be noticed now, so we would take some
fish off of the lines and cook up a hot breakfast. &nbsp;And
afterwards we would watch the lonesomeness of the river, and kind
of lazy along, and by and by lazy off to sleep. &nbsp;Wake up by
and by, and look to see what done it, and maybe see a steamboat
coughing along up-stream, so far off towards the other side you
couldn't tell nothing about her only whether she was a stern-wheel
or side-wheel; then for about an hour there wouldn't be nothing to
hear nor nothing to see&mdash;just solid lonesomeness. &nbsp;Next
you'd see a raft sliding by, away off yonder, and maybe a galoot on
it chopping, because they're most always doing it on a raft; you'd
see the axe flash and come down&mdash; you don't hear nothing; you
see that axe go up again, and by the time it's above the man's head
then you hear the K'CHUNK!&mdash;it had took all that time to come
over the water. &nbsp;So we would put in the day, lazying around,
listening to the stillness. &nbsp;Once there was a thick fog, and
the rafts and things that went by was beating tin pans so the
steamboats wouldn't run over them. &nbsp;A scow or a raft went by
so close we could hear them talking and cussing and
laughing&mdash;heard them plain; but we couldn't see no sign of
them; it made you feel crawly; it was like spirits carrying on that
way in the air. &nbsp;Jim said he believed it was spirits; but I
says:</p>
<p>"No; spirits wouldn't say, 'Dern the dern fog.'"</p>
<p>Soon as it was night out we shoved; when we got her out to about
the middle we let her alone, and let her float wherever the current
wanted her to; then we lit the pipes, and dangled our legs in the
water, and talked about all kinds of things&mdash;we was always
naked, day and night, whenever the mosquitoes would let
us&mdash;the new clothes Buck's folks made for me was too good to
be comfortable, and besides I didn't go much on clothes, nohow.</p>
<p>Sometimes we'd have that whole river all to ourselves for the
longest time. Yonder was the banks and the islands, across the
water; and maybe a spark&mdash;which was a candle in a cabin
window; and sometimes on the water you could see a spark or
two&mdash;on a raft or a scow, you know; and maybe you could hear a
fiddle or a song coming over from one of them crafts. It's lovely
to live on a raft. &nbsp;We had the sky up there, all speckled with
stars, and we used to lay on our backs and look up at them, and
discuss about whether they was made or only just happened.
&nbsp;Jim he allowed they was made, but I allowed they happened; I
judged it would have took too long to MAKE so many. &nbsp;Jim said
the moon could a LAID them; well, that looked kind of reasonable,
so I didn't say nothing against it, because I've seen a frog lay
most as many, so of course it could be done. We used to watch the
stars that fell, too, and see them streak down. &nbsp;Jim allowed
they'd got spoiled and was hove out of the nest.</p>
<p>Once or twice of a night we would see a steamboat slipping along
in the dark, and now and then she would belch a whole world of
sparks up out of her chimbleys, and they would rain down in the
river and look awful pretty; then she would turn a corner and her
lights would wink out and her powwow shut off and leave the river
still again; and by and by her waves would get to us, a long time
after she was gone, and joggle the raft a bit, and after that you
wouldn't hear nothing for you couldn't tell how long, except maybe
frogs or something.</p>
<p>After midnight the people on shore went to bed, and then for two
or three hours the shores was black&mdash;no more sparks in the
cabin windows. &nbsp;These sparks was our clock&mdash;the first one
that showed again meant morning was coming, so we hunted a place to
hide and tie up right away.</p>
<p>One morning about daybreak I found a canoe and crossed over a
chute to the main shore&mdash;it was only two hundred
yards&mdash;and paddled about a mile up a crick amongst the cypress
woods, to see if I couldn't get some berries. Just as I was passing
a place where a kind of a cowpath crossed the crick, here comes a
couple of men tearing up the path as tight as they could foot it.
&nbsp;I thought I was a goner, for whenever anybody was after
anybody I judged it was ME&mdash;or maybe Jim. &nbsp;I was about to
dig out from there in a hurry, but they was pretty close to me
then, and sung out and begged me to save their lives&mdash;said
they hadn't been doing nothing, and was being chased for
it&mdash;said there was men and dogs a-coming. &nbsp;They wanted to
jump right in, but I says:</p>

width="474" /><br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<p>"Don't you do it. &nbsp;I don't hear the dogs and horses yet;
you've got time to crowd through the brush and get up the crick a
little ways; then you take to the water and wade down to me and get
in&mdash;that'll throw the dogs off the scent."</p>
<p>They done it, and soon as they was aboard I lit out for our
towhead, and in about five or ten minutes we heard the dogs and the
men away off, shouting. We heard them come along towards the crick,
but couldn't see them; they seemed to stop and fool around a while;
then, as we got further and further away all the time, we couldn't
hardly hear them at all; by the time we had left a mile of woods
behind us and struck the river, everything was quiet, and we
paddled over to the towhead and hid in the cottonwoods and was
safe.</p>
<p>One of these fellows was about seventy or upwards, and had a
bald head and very gray whiskers. &nbsp;He had an old battered-up
slouch hat on, and a greasy blue woollen shirt, and ragged old blue
jeans britches stuffed into his boot-tops, and home-knit
galluses&mdash;no, he only had one. &nbsp;He had an old long-tailed
blue jeans coat with slick brass buttons flung over his arm, and
both of them had big, fat, ratty-looking carpet-bags.</p>
<p>The other fellow was about thirty, and dressed about as ornery.
&nbsp;After breakfast we all laid off and talked, and the first
thing that come out was that these chaps didn't know one
another.</p>
<p>"What got you into trouble?" says the baldhead to t'other
chap.</p>
<p>"Well, I'd been selling an article to take the tartar off the
teeth&mdash;and it does take it off, too, and generly the enamel
along with it&mdash;but I stayed about one night longer than I
ought to, and was just in the act of sliding out when I ran across
you on the trail this side of town, and you told me they were
coming, and begged me to help you to get off. &nbsp;So I told you I
was expecting trouble myself, and would scatter out WITH you.
That's the whole yarn&mdash;what's yourn?</p>
<p>"Well, I'd ben a-running' a little temperance revival thar 'bout
a week, and was the pet of the women folks, big and little, for I
was makin' it mighty warm for the rummies, I TELL you, and takin'
as much as five or six dollars a night&mdash;ten cents a head,
children and niggers free&mdash;and business a-growin' all the
time, when somehow or another a little report got around last night
that I had a way of puttin' in my time with a private jug on the
sly. &nbsp;A nigger rousted me out this mornin', and told me the
people was getherin' on the quiet with their dogs and horses, and
they'd be along pretty soon and give me 'bout half an hour's start,
and then run me down if they could; and if they got me they'd tar
and feather me and ride me on a rail, sure. &nbsp;I didn't wait for
no breakfast&mdash;I warn't hungry."</p>
<p>"Old man," said the young one, "I reckon we might double-team it
together; what do you think?"</p>
<p>"I ain't undisposed. &nbsp;What's your line&mdash;mainly?"</p>
<p>"Jour printer by trade; do a little in patent medicines;
theater-actor&mdash;tragedy, you know; take a turn to mesmerism and
phrenology when there's a chance; teach singing-geography school
for a change; sling a lecture sometimes&mdash;oh, I do lots of
things&mdash;most anything that comes handy, so it ain't work.
&nbsp;What's your lay?"</p>
<p>"I've done considerble in the doctoring way in my time.
&nbsp;Layin' on o' hands is my best holt&mdash;for cancer and
paralysis, and sich things; and I k'n tell a fortune pretty good
when I've got somebody along to find out the facts for me.
&nbsp;Preachin's my line, too, and workin' camp-meetin's, and
missionaryin' around."</p>
<p>Nobody never said anything for a while; then the young man hove
a sigh and says:</p>
<p>"Alas!"</p>
<p>"What 're you alassin' about?" says the bald-head.</p>
<p>"To think I should have lived to be leading such a life, and be
degraded down into such company." &nbsp;And he begun to wipe the
corner of his eye with a rag.</p>
<p>"Dern your skin, ain't the company good enough for you?" says
the baldhead, pretty pert and uppish.</p>
<p>"Yes, it IS good enough for me; it's as good as I deserve; for
who fetched me so low when I was so high? &nbsp;I did myself.
&nbsp;I don't blame YOU, gentlemen&mdash;far from it; I don't blame
anybody. &nbsp;I deserve it all. &nbsp;Let the cold world do its
worst; one thing I know&mdash;there's a grave somewhere for me. The
world may go on just as it's always done, and take everything from
me&mdash;loved ones, property, everything; but it can't take that.
Some day I'll lie down in it and forget it all, and my poor broken
heart will be at rest." &nbsp;He went on a-wiping.</p>
<p>"Drot your pore broken heart," says the baldhead; "what are you
heaving your pore broken heart at US f'r? &nbsp;WE hain't done
nothing."</p>
<p>"No, I know you haven't. &nbsp;I ain't blaming you, gentlemen.
&nbsp;I brought myself down&mdash;yes, I did it myself. &nbsp;It's
right I should suffer&mdash;perfectly right&mdash;I don't make any
moan."</p>
<p>"Brought you down from whar? &nbsp;Whar was you brought down
from?"</p>
<p>"Ah, you would not believe me; the world never
believes&mdash;let it pass&mdash;'tis no matter. &nbsp;The secret
of my birth&mdash;"</p>
<p>"The secret of your birth! &nbsp;Do you mean to say&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Gentlemen," says the young man, very solemn, "I will reveal it
to you, for I feel I may have confidence in you. &nbsp;By rights I
am a duke!"</p>
<br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
<br />
<p>Jim's eyes bugged out when he heard that; and I reckon mine did,
too. Then the baldhead says: &nbsp;"No! you can't mean it?"</p>
<p>"Yes. &nbsp;My great-grandfather, eldest son of the Duke of
Bridgewater, fled to this country about the end of the last
century, to breathe the pure air of freedom; married here, and
died, leaving a son, his own father dying about the same time.
&nbsp;The second son of the late duke seized the titles and
estates&mdash;the infant real duke was ignored. &nbsp;I am the
lineal descendant of that infant&mdash;I am the rightful Duke of
Bridgewater; and here am I, forlorn, torn from my high estate,
hunted of men, despised by the cold world, ragged, worn,
heart-broken, and degraded to the companionship of felons on a
raft!"</p>
<p>Jim pitied him ever so much, and so did I. We tried to comfort
him, but he said it warn't much use, he couldn't be much comforted;
said if we was a mind to acknowledge him, that would do him more
good than most anything else; so we said we would, if he would tell
us how. &nbsp;He said we ought to bow when we spoke to him, and say
"Your Grace," or "My Lord," or "Your Lordship"&mdash;and he
wouldn't mind it if we called him plain "Bridgewater," which, he
said, was a title anyway, and not a name; and one of us ought to
wait on him at dinner, and do any little thing for him he wanted
done.</p>
<p>Well, that was all easy, so we done it. &nbsp;All through dinner
Jim stood around and waited on him, and says, "Will yo' Grace have
some o' dis or some o' dat?" and so on, and a body could see it was
mighty pleasing to him.</p>
<p>But the old man got pretty silent by and by&mdash;didn't have
much to say, and didn't look pretty comfortable over all that
petting that was going on around that duke. &nbsp;He seemed to have
something on his mind. &nbsp;So, along in the afternoon, he
says:</p>
<p>"Looky here, Bilgewater," he says, "I'm nation sorry for you,
but you ain't the only person that's had troubles like that."</p>
<p>"No?"</p>
<p>"No you ain't. &nbsp;You ain't the only person that's ben snaked
down wrongfully out'n a high place."</p>
<p>"Alas!"</p>
<p>"No, you ain't the only person that's had a secret of his
birth." &nbsp;And, by jings, HE begins to cry.</p>
<p>"Hold! &nbsp;What do you mean?"</p>
<p>"Bilgewater, kin I trust you?" says the old man, still sort of
sobbing.</p>
<p>"To the bitter death!" &nbsp;He took the old man by the hand and
squeezed it, and says, "That secret of your being:
&nbsp;speak!"</p>
<p>"Bilgewater, I am the late Dauphin!"</p>
<br />
<br />

width="464" /><br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<p>You bet you, Jim and me stared this time. &nbsp;Then the duke
says:</p>
<p>"You are what?"</p>
<p>"Yes, my friend, it is too true&mdash;your eyes is lookin' at
this very moment on the pore disappeared Dauphin, Looy the
Seventeen, son of Looy the Sixteen and Marry Antonette."</p>
<p>"You! &nbsp;At your age! &nbsp;No! &nbsp;You mean you're the
late Charlemagne; you must be six or seven hundred years old, at
the very least."</p>
<p>"Trouble has done it, Bilgewater, trouble has done it; trouble
has brung these gray hairs and this premature balditude. &nbsp;Yes,
gentlemen, you see before you, in blue jeans and misery, the
wanderin', exiled, trampled-on, and sufferin' rightful King of
France."</p>
<p>Well, he cried and took on so that me and Jim didn't know hardly
what to do, we was so sorry&mdash;and so glad and proud we'd got
him with us, too. &nbsp;So we set in, like we done before with the
duke, and tried to comfort HIM. But he said it warn't no use,
nothing but to be dead and done with it all could do him any good;
though he said it often made him feel easier and better for a while
if people treated him according to his rights, and got down on one
knee to speak to him, and always called him "Your Majesty," and
waited on him first at meals, and didn't set down in his presence
till he asked them. So Jim and me set to majestying him, and doing
this and that and t'other for him, and standing up till he told us
we might set down. &nbsp;This done him heaps of good, and so he got
cheerful and comfortable. &nbsp;But the duke kind of soured on him,
and didn't look a bit satisfied with the way things was going;
still, the king acted real friendly towards him, and said the
duke's great-grandfather and all the other Dukes of Bilgewater was
a good deal thought of by HIS father, and was allowed to come to
the palace considerable; but the duke stayed huffy a good while,
till by and by the king says:</p>
<p>"Like as not we got to be together a blamed long time on this
h-yer raft, Bilgewater, and so what's the use o' your bein' sour?
&nbsp;It 'll only make things oncomfortable. &nbsp;It ain't my
fault I warn't born a duke, it ain't your fault you warn't born a
king&mdash;so what's the use to worry? &nbsp;Make the best o'
things the way you find 'em, says I&mdash;that's my motto.
&nbsp;This ain't no bad thing that we've struck here&mdash;plenty
grub and an easy life&mdash;come, give us your hand, duke, and le's
all be friends."</p>
<p>The duke done it, and Jim and me was pretty glad to see it.
&nbsp;It took away all the uncomfortableness and we felt mighty
good over it, because it would a been a miserable business to have
any unfriendliness on the raft; for what you want, above all
things, on a raft, is for everybody to be satisfied, and feel right
and kind towards the others.</p>
<p>It didn't take me long to make up my mind that these liars
warn't no kings nor dukes at all, but just low-down humbugs and
frauds. &nbsp;But I never said nothing, never let on; kept it to
myself; it's the best way; then you don't have no quarrels, and
don't get into no trouble. &nbsp;If they wanted us to call them
kings and dukes, I hadn't no objections, 'long as it would keep
peace in the family; and it warn't no use to tell Jim, so I didn't
tell him. &nbsp;If I never learnt nothing else out of pap, I learnt
that the best way to get along with his kind of people is to let
them have their own way.</p>

CHAPTER XX.</p>
<p>THEY asked us considerable many questions; wanted to know what
we covered up the raft that way for, and laid by in the daytime
instead of running&mdash;was Jim a runaway nigger? &nbsp;Says
I:</p>
<p>"Goodness sakes! would a runaway nigger run SOUTH?"</p>
<p>No, they allowed he wouldn't. &nbsp;I had to account for things
some way, so I says:</p>
<p>"My folks was living in Pike County, in Missouri, where I was
born, and they all died off but me and pa and my brother Ike.
&nbsp;Pa, he 'lowed he'd break up and go down and live with Uncle
Ben, who's got a little one-horse place on the river, forty-four
mile below Orleans. &nbsp;Pa was pretty poor, and had some debts;
so when he'd squared up there warn't nothing left but sixteen
dollars and our nigger, Jim. &nbsp;That warn't enough to take us
fourteen hundred mile, deck passage nor no other way. &nbsp;Well,
when the river rose pa had a streak of luck one day; he ketched
this piece of a raft; so we reckoned we'd go down to Orleans on it.
&nbsp;Pa's luck didn't hold out; a steamboat run over the forrard
corner of the raft one night, and we all went overboard and dove
under the wheel; Jim and me come up all right, but pa was drunk,
and Ike was only four years old, so they never come up no more.
&nbsp;Well, for the next day or two we had considerable trouble,
because people was always coming out in skiffs and trying to take
Jim away from me, saying they believed he was a runaway nigger.
&nbsp;We don't run daytimes no more now; nights they don't bother
us."</p>
<p>The duke says:</p>
<p>"Leave me alone to cipher out a way so we can run in the daytime
if we want to. &nbsp;I'll think the thing over&mdash;I'll invent a
plan that'll fix it. We'll let it alone for to-day, because of
course we don't want to go by that town yonder in daylight&mdash;it
mightn't be healthy."</p>
<p>Towards night it begun to darken up and look like rain; the heat
lightning was squirting around low down in the sky, and the leaves
was beginning to shiver&mdash;it was going to be pretty ugly, it
was easy to see that. &nbsp;So the duke and the king went to
overhauling our wigwam, to see what the beds was like. &nbsp;My bed
was a straw tick better than Jim's, which was a corn-shuck tick;
there's always cobs around about in a shuck tick, and they poke
into you and hurt; and when you roll over the dry shucks sound like
you was rolling over in a pile of dead leaves; it makes such a
rustling that you wake up. &nbsp;Well, the duke allowed he would
take my bed; but the king allowed he wouldn't. &nbsp;He says:</p>
<p>"I should a reckoned the difference in rank would a sejested to
you that a corn-shuck bed warn't just fitten for me to sleep on.
&nbsp;Your Grace 'll take the shuck bed yourself."</p>
<p>Jim and me was in a sweat again for a minute, being afraid there
was going to be some more trouble amongst them; so we was pretty
glad when the duke says:</p>
<p>"'Tis my fate to be always ground into the mire under the iron
heel of oppression. &nbsp;Misfortune has broken my once haughty
spirit; I yield, I submit; 'tis my fate. &nbsp;I am alone in the
world&mdash;let me suffer; can bear it."</p>
<p>We got away as soon as it was good and dark. &nbsp;The king told
us to stand well out towards the middle of the river, and not show
a light till we got a long ways below the town. &nbsp;We come in
sight of the little bunch of lights by and by&mdash;that was the
town, you know&mdash;and slid by, about a half a mile out, all
right. &nbsp;When we was three-quarters of a mile below we hoisted
up our signal lantern; and about ten o'clock it come on to rain and
blow and thunder and lighten like everything; so the king told us
to both stay on watch till the weather got better; then him and the
duke crawled into the wigwam and turned in for the night. &nbsp;It
was my watch below till twelve, but I wouldn't a turned in anyway
if I'd had a bed, because a body don't see such a storm as that
every day in the week, not by a long sight. &nbsp;My souls, how the
wind did scream along! &nbsp;And every second or two there'd come a
glare that lit up the white-caps for a half a mile around, and
you'd see the islands looking dusty through the rain, and the trees
thrashing around in the wind; then comes a H-WHACK!&mdash;bum! bum!
bumble-umble-um-bum-bum-bum-bum&mdash;and the thunder would go
rumbling and grumbling away, and quit&mdash;and then RIP comes
another flash and another sockdolager. &nbsp;The waves most washed
me off the raft sometimes, but I hadn't any clothes on, and didn't
mind. &nbsp;We didn't have no trouble about snags; the lightning
was glaring and flittering around so constant that we could see
them plenty soon enough to throw her head this way or that and miss
them.</p>
<p>I had the middle watch, you know, but I was pretty sleepy by
that time, so Jim he said he would stand the first half of it for
me; he was always mighty good that way, Jim was. &nbsp;I crawled
into the wigwam, but the king and the duke had their legs sprawled
around so there warn't no show for me; so I laid outside&mdash;I
didn't mind the rain, because it was warm, and the waves warn't
running so high now. &nbsp;About two they come up again, though,
and Jim was going to call me; but he changed his mind, because he
reckoned they warn't high enough yet to do any harm; but he was
mistaken about that, for pretty soon all of a sudden along comes a
regular ripper and washed me overboard. &nbsp;It most killed Jim
a-laughing. &nbsp;He was the easiest nigger to laugh that ever was,
anyway.</p>
<p>I took the watch, and Jim he laid down and snored away; and by
and by the storm let up for good and all; and the first cabin-light
that showed I rousted him out, and we slid the raft into hiding
quarters for the day.</p>
<p>The king got out an old ratty deck of cards after breakfast, and
him and the duke played seven-up a while, five cents a game.
&nbsp;Then they got tired of it, and allowed they would "lay out a
campaign," as they called it. The duke went down into his
carpet-bag, and fetched up a lot of little printed bills and read
them out loud. &nbsp;One bill said, "The celebrated Dr. Armand de
Montalban, of Paris," would "lecture on the Science of Phrenology"
at such and such a place, on the blank day of blank, at ten cents
admission, and "furnish charts of character at twenty-five cents
apiece." &nbsp;The duke said that was HIM. &nbsp;In another bill he
was the "world-renowned Shakespearian tragedian, Garrick the
Younger, of Drury Lane, London." &nbsp;In other bills he had a lot
of other names and done other wonderful things, like finding water
and gold with a "divining-rod," "dissipating witch spells," and so
on. &nbsp;By and by he says:</p>
<p>"But the histrionic muse is the darling. &nbsp;Have you ever
trod the boards, Royalty?"</p>
<p>"No," says the king.</p>
<p>"You shall, then, before you're three days older, Fallen
Grandeur," says the duke. &nbsp;"The first good town we come to
we'll hire a hall and do the sword fight in Richard III. and the
balcony scene in Romeo and Juliet. How does that strike you?"</p>
<p>"I'm in, up to the hub, for anything that will pay, Bilgewater;
but, you see, I don't know nothing about play-actin', and hain't
ever seen much of it. &nbsp;I was too small when pap used to have
'em at the palace. &nbsp;Do you reckon you can learn me?"</p>
<p>"Easy!"</p>
<p>"All right. &nbsp;I'm jist a-freezn' for something fresh,
anyway. &nbsp;Le's commence right away."</p>
<p>So the duke he told him all about who Romeo was and who Juliet
was, and said he was used to being Romeo, so the king could be
Juliet.</p>
<p>"But if Juliet's such a young gal, duke, my peeled head and my
white whiskers is goin' to look oncommon odd on her, maybe."</p>
<p>"No, don't you worry; these country jakes won't ever think of
that. Besides, you know, you'll be in costume, and that makes all
the difference in the world; Juliet's in a balcony, enjoying the
moonlight before she goes to bed, and she's got on her night-gown
and her ruffled nightcap. &nbsp;Here are the costumes for the
parts."</p>

<br />
<br />
<p>He got out two or three curtain-calico suits, which he said was
meedyevil armor for Richard III. and t'other chap, and a long white
cotton nightshirt and a ruffled nightcap to match. &nbsp;The king
was satisfied; so the duke got out his book and read the parts over
in the most splendid spread-eagle way, prancing around and acting
at the same time, to show how it had got to be done; then he give
the book to the king and told him to get his part by heart.</p>
<p>There was a little one-horse town about three mile down the
bend, and after dinner the duke said he had ciphered out his idea
about how to run in daylight without it being dangersome for Jim;
so he allowed he would go down to the town and fix that thing.
&nbsp;The king allowed he would go, too, and see if he couldn't
strike something. &nbsp;We was out of coffee, so Jim said I better
go along with them in the canoe and get some.</p>
<p>When we got there there warn't nobody stirring; streets empty,
and perfectly dead and still, like Sunday. &nbsp;We found a sick
nigger sunning himself in a back yard, and he said everybody that
warn't too young or too sick or too old was gone to camp-meeting,
about two mile back in the woods. &nbsp;The king got the
directions, and allowed he'd go and work that camp-meeting for all
it was worth, and I might go, too.</p>
<p>The duke said what he was after was a printing-office. &nbsp;We
found it; a little bit of a concern, up over a carpenter
shop&mdash;carpenters and printers all gone to the meeting, and no
doors locked. &nbsp;It was a dirty, littered-up place, and had ink
marks, and handbills with pictures of horses and runaway niggers on
them, all over the walls. &nbsp;The duke shed his coat and said he
was all right now. &nbsp;So me and the king lit out for the
camp-meeting.</p>
<p>We got there in about a half an hour fairly dripping, for it was
a most awful hot day. &nbsp;There was as much as a thousand people
there from twenty mile around. &nbsp;The woods was full of teams
and wagons, hitched everywheres, feeding out of the wagon-troughs
and stomping to keep off the flies. &nbsp;There was sheds made out
of poles and roofed over with branches, where they had lemonade and
gingerbread to sell, and piles of watermelons and green corn and
such-like truck.</p>
<p>The preaching was going on under the same kinds of sheds, only
they was bigger and held crowds of people. &nbsp;The benches was
made out of outside slabs of logs, with holes bored in the round
side to drive sticks into for legs. They didn't have no backs.
&nbsp;The preachers had high platforms to stand on at one end of
the sheds. &nbsp;The women had on sun-bonnets; and some had
linsey-woolsey frocks, some gingham ones, and a few of the young
ones had on calico. &nbsp;Some of the young men was barefooted, and
some of the children didn't have on any clothes but just a
tow-linen shirt. &nbsp;Some of the old women was knitting, and some
of the young folks was courting on the sly.</p>

<p>The first shed we come to the preacher was lining out a hymn.
&nbsp;He lined out two lines, everybody sung it, and it was kind of
grand to hear it, there was so many of them and they done it in
such a rousing way; then he lined out two more for them to
sing&mdash;and so on. &nbsp;The people woke up more and more, and
sung louder and louder; and towards the end some begun to groan,
and some begun to shout. &nbsp;Then the preacher begun to preach,
and begun in earnest, too; and went weaving first to one side of
the platform and then the other, and then a-leaning down over the
front of it, with his arms and his body going all the time, and
shouting his words out with all his might; and every now and then
he would hold up his Bible and spread it open, and kind of pass it
around this way and that, shouting, "It's the brazen serpent in the
wilderness! &nbsp;Look upon it and live!" &nbsp;And people would
shout out, "Glory!&mdash;A-a-MEN!" &nbsp;And so he went on, and the
people groaning and crying and saying amen:</p>
<p>"Oh, come to the mourners' bench! come, black with sin! (AMEN!)
come, sick and sore! (AMEN!) come, lame and halt and blind! (AMEN!)
come, pore and needy, sunk in shame! (A-A-MEN!) come, all that's
worn and soiled and suffering!&mdash;come with a broken spirit!
come with a contrite heart! come in your rags and sin and dirt! the
waters that cleanse is free, the door of heaven stands
open&mdash;oh, enter in and be at rest!" (A-A-MEN! &nbsp;GLORY,
GLORY HALLELUJAH!)</p>
<p>And so on. &nbsp;You couldn't make out what the preacher said
any more, on account of the shouting and crying. &nbsp;Folks got up
everywheres in the crowd, and worked their way just by main
strength to the mourners' bench, with the tears running down their
faces; and when all the mourners had got up there to the front
benches in a crowd, they sung and shouted and flung themselves down
on the straw, just crazy and wild.</p>
<p>Well, the first I knowed the king got a-going, and you could
hear him over everybody; and next he went a-charging up on to the
platform, and the preacher he begged him to speak to the people,
and he done it. &nbsp;He told them he was a pirate&mdash;been a
pirate for thirty years out in the Indian Ocean&mdash;and his crew
was thinned out considerable last spring in a fight, and he was
home now to take out some fresh men, and thanks to goodness he'd
been robbed last night and put ashore off of a steamboat without a
cent, and he was glad of it; it was the blessedest thing that ever
happened to him, because he was a changed man now, and happy for
the first time in his life; and, poor as he was, he was going to
start right off and work his way back to the Indian Ocean, and put
in the rest of his life trying to turn the pirates into the true
path; for he could do it better than anybody else, being acquainted
with all pirate crews in that ocean; and though it would take him a
long time to get there without money, he would get there anyway,
and every time he convinced a pirate he would say to him, "Don't
you thank me, don't you give me no credit; it all belongs to them
dear people in Pokeville camp-meeting, natural brothers and
benefactors of the race, and that dear preacher there, the truest
friend a pirate ever had!"</p>

<br />
<br />
<p>And then he busted into tears, and so did everybody. &nbsp;Then
somebody sings out, "Take up a collection for him, take up a
collection!" &nbsp;Well, a half a dozen made a jump to do it, but
somebody sings out, "Let HIM pass the hat around!" &nbsp;Then
everybody said it, the preacher too.</p>
<p>So the king went all through the crowd with his hat swabbing his
eyes, and blessing the people and praising them and thanking them
for being so good to the poor pirates away off there; and every
little while the prettiest kind of girls, with the tears running
down their cheeks, would up and ask him would he let them kiss him
for to remember him by; and he always done it; and some of them he
hugged and kissed as many as five or six times&mdash;and he was
invited to stay a week; and everybody wanted him to live in their
houses, and said they'd think it was an honor; but he said as this
was the last day of the camp-meeting he couldn't do no good, and
besides he was in a sweat to get to the Indian Ocean right off and
go to work on the pirates.</p>
<p>When we got back to the raft and he come to count up he found he
had collected eighty-seven dollars and seventy-five cents.
&nbsp;And then he had fetched away a three-gallon jug of whisky,
too, that he found under a wagon when he was starting home through
the woods. &nbsp;The king said, take it all around, it laid over
any day he'd ever put in in the missionarying line. &nbsp;He said
it warn't no use talking, heathens don't amount to shucks alongside
of pirates to work a camp-meeting with.</p>
<p>The duke was thinking HE'D been doing pretty well till the king
come to show up, but after that he didn't think so so much.
&nbsp;He had set up and printed off two little jobs for farmers in
that printing-office&mdash;horse bills&mdash;and took the money,
four dollars. &nbsp;And he had got in ten dollars' worth of
advertisements for the paper, which he said he would put in for
four dollars if they would pay in advance&mdash;so they done it.
The price of the paper was two dollars a year, but he took in three
subscriptions for half a dollar apiece on condition of them paying
him in advance; they were going to pay in cordwood and onions as
usual, but he said he had just bought the concern and knocked down
the price as low as he could afford it, and was going to run it for
cash. &nbsp;He set up a little piece of poetry, which he made,
himself, out of his own head&mdash;three verses&mdash;kind of sweet
and saddish&mdash;the name of it was, "Yes, crush, cold world, this
breaking heart"&mdash;and he left that all set up and ready to
print in the paper, and didn't charge nothing for it. &nbsp;Well,
he took in nine dollars and a half, and said he'd done a pretty
square day's work for it.</p>
<p>Then he showed us another little job he'd printed and hadn't
charged for, because it was for us. &nbsp;It had a picture of a
runaway nigger with a bundle on a stick over his shoulder, and
"$200 reward" under it. &nbsp;The reading was all about Jim, and
just described him to a dot. &nbsp;It said he run away from St.
Jacques' plantation, forty mile below New Orleans, last winter, and
likely went north, and whoever would catch him and send him back he
could have the reward and expenses.</p>

<br />
<br />
<br />
<p>"Now," says the duke, "after to-night we can run in the daytime
if we want to. &nbsp;Whenever we see anybody coming we can tie Jim
hand and foot with a rope, and lay him in the wigwam and show this
handbill and say we captured him up the river, and were too poor to
travel on a steamboat, so we got this little raft on credit from
our friends and are going down to get the reward. &nbsp;Handcuffs
and chains would look still better on Jim, but it wouldn't go well
with the story of us being so poor. &nbsp;Too much like jewelry.
&nbsp;Ropes are the correct thing&mdash;we must preserve the
unities, as we say on the boards."</p>
<p>We all said the duke was pretty smart, and there couldn't be no
trouble about running daytimes. &nbsp;We judged we could make miles
enough that night to get out of the reach of the powwow we reckoned
the duke's work in the printing office was going to make in that
little town; then we could boom right along if we wanted to.</p>
<p>We laid low and kept still, and never shoved out till nearly ten
o'clock; then we slid by, pretty wide away from the town, and
didn't hoist our lantern till we was clear out of sight of it.</p>
<p>When Jim called me to take the watch at four in the morning, he
says:</p>
<p>"Huck, does you reck'n we gwyne to run acrost any mo' kings on
dis trip?"</p>
<p>"No," I says, "I reckon not."</p>
<p>"Well," says he, "dat's all right, den. &nbsp;I doan' mine one
er two kings, but dat's enough. &nbsp;Dis one's powerful drunk, en
de duke ain' much better."</p>
<p>I found Jim had been trying to get him to talk French, so he
could hear what it was like; but he said he had been in this
country so long, and had so much trouble, he'd forgot it.</p>

CHAPTER XXI.</p>
<p>IT was after sun-up now, but we went right on and didn't tie up.
&nbsp;The king and the duke turned out by and by looking pretty
rusty; but after they'd jumped overboard and took a swim it
chippered them up a good deal. After breakfast the king he took a
seat on the corner of the raft, and pulled off his boots and rolled
up his britches, and let his legs dangle in the water, so as to be
comfortable, and lit his pipe, and went to getting his Romeo and
Juliet by heart. &nbsp;When he had got it pretty good him and the
duke begun to practice it together. &nbsp;The duke had to learn him
over and over again how to say every speech; and he made him sigh,
and put his hand on his heart, and after a while he said he done it
pretty well; "only," he says, "you mustn't bellow out ROMEO! that
way, like a bull&mdash;you must say it soft and sick and languishy,
so&mdash;R-o-o-meo! that is the idea; for Juliet's a dear sweet
mere child of a girl, you know, and she doesn't bray like a
jackass."</p>
<p>Well, next they got out a couple of long swords that the duke
made out of oak laths, and begun to practice the sword
fight&mdash;the duke called himself Richard III.; and the way they
laid on and pranced around the raft was grand to see. &nbsp;But by
and by the king tripped and fell overboard, and after that they
took a rest, and had a talk about all kinds of adventures they'd
had in other times along the river.</p>
<p>After dinner the duke says:</p>
<p>"Well, Capet, we'll want to make this a first-class show, you
know, so I guess we'll add a little more to it. &nbsp;We want a
little something to answer encores with, anyway."</p>
<p>"What's onkores, Bilgewater?"</p>
<p>The duke told him, and then says:</p>
<p>"I'll answer by doing the Highland fling or the sailor's
hornpipe; and you&mdash;well, let me see&mdash;oh, I've got
it&mdash;you can do Hamlet's soliloquy."</p>
<p>"Hamlet's which?"</p>
<p>"Hamlet's soliloquy, you know; the most celebrated thing in
Shakespeare. Ah, it's sublime, sublime! &nbsp;Always fetches the
house. &nbsp;I haven't got it in the book&mdash;I've only got one
volume&mdash;but I reckon I can piece it out from memory.
&nbsp;I'll just walk up and down a minute, and see if I can call it
back from recollection's vaults."</p>

<p>So he went to marching up and down, thinking, and frowning
horrible every now and then; then he would hoist up his eyebrows;
next he would squeeze his hand on his forehead and stagger back and
kind of moan; next he would sigh, and next he'd let on to drop a
tear. &nbsp;It was beautiful to see him. By and by he got it.
&nbsp;He told us to give attention. &nbsp;Then he strikes a most
noble attitude, with one leg shoved forwards, and his arms
stretched away up, and his head tilted back, looking up at the sky;
and then he begins to rip and rave and grit his teeth; and after
that, all through his speech, he howled, and spread around, and
swelled up his chest, and just knocked the spots out of any acting
ever I see before. &nbsp;This is the speech&mdash;I learned it,
easy enough, while he was learning it to the king:</p>

<p>All the stores was along one street. &nbsp;They had white
domestic awnings in front, and the country people hitched their
horses to the awning-posts. There was empty drygoods boxes under
the awnings, and loafers roosting on them all day long, whittling
them with their Barlow knives; and chawing tobacco, and gaping and
yawning and stretching&mdash;a mighty ornery lot. They generly had
on yellow straw hats most as wide as an umbrella, but didn't wear
no coats nor waistcoats, they called one another Bill, and Buck,
and Hank, and Joe, and Andy, and talked lazy and drawly, and used
considerable many cuss words. &nbsp;There was as many as one loafer
leaning up against every awning-post, and he most always had his
hands in his britches-pockets, except when he fetched them out to
lend a chaw of tobacco or scratch. &nbsp;What a body was hearing
amongst them all the time was:</p>
<p>"Gimme a chaw 'v tobacker, Hank."</p>
<p>"Cain't; I hain't got but one chaw left. &nbsp;Ask Bill."</p>
<br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
<br />
<p>Maybe Bill he gives him a chaw; maybe he lies and says he ain't
got none. Some of them kinds of loafers never has a cent in the
world, nor a chaw of tobacco of their own. &nbsp;They get all their
chawing by borrowing; they say to a fellow, "I wisht you'd len' me
a chaw, Jack, I jist this minute give Ben Thompson the last chaw I
had"&mdash;which is a lie pretty much everytime; it don't fool
nobody but a stranger; but Jack ain't no stranger, so he says:</p>
<p>"YOU give him a chaw, did you? &nbsp;So did your sister's cat's
grandmother. You pay me back the chaws you've awready borry'd off'n
me, Lafe Buckner, then I'll loan you one or two ton of it, and
won't charge you no back intrust, nuther."</p>
<p>"Well, I DID pay you back some of it wunst."</p>
<p>"Yes, you did&mdash;'bout six chaws. &nbsp;You borry'd store
tobacker and paid back nigger-head."</p>
<p>Store tobacco is flat black plug, but these fellows mostly chaws
the natural leaf twisted. &nbsp;When they borrow a chaw they don't
generly cut it off with a knife, but set the plug in between their
teeth, and gnaw with their teeth and tug at the plug with their
hands till they get it in two; then sometimes the one that owns the
tobacco looks mournful at it when it's handed back, and says,
sarcastic:</p>
<p>"Here, gimme the CHAW, and you take the PLUG."</p>
<p>All the streets and lanes was just mud; they warn't nothing else
BUT mud&mdash;mud as black as tar and nigh about a foot deep in
some places, and two or three inches deep in ALL the places.
&nbsp;The hogs loafed and grunted around everywheres. &nbsp;You'd
see a muddy sow and a litter of pigs come lazying along the street
and whollop herself right down in the way, where folks had to walk
around her, and she'd stretch out and shut her eyes and wave her
ears whilst the pigs was milking her, and look as happy as if she
was on salary. And pretty soon you'd hear a loafer sing out, "Hi!
&nbsp;SO boy! sick him, Tige!" and away the sow would go, squealing
most horrible, with a dog or two swinging to each ear, and three or
four dozen more a-coming; and then you would see all the loafers
get up and watch the thing out of sight, and laugh at the fun and
look grateful for the noise. &nbsp;Then they'd settle back again
till there was a dog fight. &nbsp;There couldn't anything wake them
up all over, and make them happy all over, like a dog
fight&mdash;unless it might be putting turpentine on a stray dog
and setting fire to him, or tying a tin pan to his tail and see him
run himself to death.</p>
<p>On the river front some of the houses was sticking out over the
bank, and they was bowed and bent, and about ready to tumble in,
The people had moved out of them. &nbsp;The bank was caved away
under one corner of some others, and that corner was hanging over.
&nbsp;People lived in them yet, but it was dangersome, because
sometimes a strip of land as wide as a house caves in at a time.
&nbsp;Sometimes a belt of land a quarter of a mile deep will start
in and cave along and cave along till it all caves into the river
in one summer. Such a town as that has to be always moving back,
and back, and back, because the river's always gnawing at it.</p>
<p>The nearer it got to noon that day the thicker and thicker was
the wagons and horses in the streets, and more coming all the time.
&nbsp;Families fetched their dinners with them from the country,
and eat them in the wagons. &nbsp;There was considerable whisky
drinking going on, and I seen three fights. &nbsp;By and by
somebody sings out:</p>
<p>"Here comes old Boggs!&mdash;in from the country for his little
old monthly drunk; here he comes, boys!"</p>
<p>All the loafers looked glad; I reckoned they was used to having
fun out of Boggs. &nbsp;One of them says:</p>
<p>"Wonder who he's a-gwyne to chaw up this time. &nbsp;If he'd
a-chawed up all the men he's ben a-gwyne to chaw up in the last
twenty year he'd have considerable ruputation now."</p>
<p>Another one says, "I wisht old Boggs 'd threaten me, 'cuz then
I'd know I warn't gwyne to die for a thousan' year."</p>
<p>Boggs comes a-tearing along on his horse, whooping and yelling
like an Injun, and singing out:</p>
<p>"Cler the track, thar. &nbsp;I'm on the waw-path, and the price
uv coffins is a-gwyne to raise."</p>

<br />
<p>He was drunk, and weaving about in his saddle; he was over fifty
year old, and had a very red face. &nbsp;Everybody yelled at him
and laughed at him and sassed him, and he sassed back, and said
he'd attend to them and lay them out in their regular turns, but he
couldn't wait now because he'd come to town to kill old Colonel
Sherburn, and his motto was, "Meat first, and spoon vittles to top
off on."</p>
<p>He see me, and rode up and says:</p>
<p>"Whar'd you come f'm, boy? &nbsp;You prepared to die?"</p>
<p>Then he rode on. &nbsp;I was scared, but a man says:</p>
<p>"He don't mean nothing; he's always a-carryin' on like that when
he's drunk. &nbsp;He's the best naturedest old fool in
Arkansaw&mdash;never hurt nobody, drunk nor sober."</p>
<p>Boggs rode up before the biggest store in town, and bent his
head down so he could see under the curtain of the awning and
yells:</p>
<p>"Come out here, Sherburn! Come out and meet the man you've
swindled. You're the houn' I'm after, and I'm a-gwyne to have you,
too!"</p>
<p>And so he went on, calling Sherburn everything he could lay his
tongue to, and the whole street packed with people listening and
laughing and going on. &nbsp;By and by a proud-looking man about
fifty-five&mdash;and he was a heap the best dressed man in that
town, too&mdash;steps out of the store, and the crowd drops back on
each side to let him come. &nbsp;He says to Boggs, mighty ca'm and
slow&mdash;he says:</p>
<p>"I'm tired of this, but I'll endure it till one o'clock.
&nbsp;Till one o'clock, mind&mdash;no longer. &nbsp;If you open
your mouth against me only once after that time you can't travel so
far but I will find you."</p>
<p>Then he turns and goes in. &nbsp;The crowd looked mighty sober;
nobody stirred, and there warn't no more laughing. &nbsp;Boggs rode
off blackguarding Sherburn as loud as he could yell, all down the
street; and pretty soon back he comes and stops before the store,
still keeping it up. &nbsp;Some men crowded around him and tried to
get him to shut up, but he wouldn't; they told him it would be one
o'clock in about fifteen minutes, and so he MUST go home&mdash;he
must go right away. &nbsp;But it didn't do no good. &nbsp;He cussed
away with all his might, and throwed his hat down in the mud and
rode over it, and pretty soon away he went a-raging down the street
again, with his gray hair a-flying. Everybody that could get a
chance at him tried their best to coax him off of his horse so they
could lock him up and get him sober; but it warn't no use&mdash;up
the street he would tear again, and give Sherburn another cussing.
&nbsp;By and by somebody says:</p>
<p>"Go for his daughter!&mdash;quick, go for his daughter;
sometimes he'll listen to her. &nbsp;If anybody can persuade him,
she can."</p>
<p>So somebody started on a run. &nbsp;I walked down street a ways
and stopped. In about five or ten minutes here comes Boggs again,
but not on his horse. &nbsp;He was a-reeling across the street
towards me, bare-headed, with a friend on both sides of him a-holt
of his arms and hurrying him along. He was quiet, and looked
uneasy; and he warn't hanging back any, but was doing some of the
hurrying himself. &nbsp;Somebody sings out:</p>
<p>"Boggs!"</p>
<p>I looked over there to see who said it, and it was that Colonel
Sherburn. He was standing perfectly still in the street, and had a
pistol raised in his right hand&mdash;not aiming it, but holding it
out with the barrel tilted up towards the sky. &nbsp;The same
second I see a young girl coming on the run, and two men with her.
&nbsp;Boggs and the men turned round to see who called him, and
when they see the pistol the men jumped to one side, and the
pistol-barrel come down slow and steady to a level&mdash;both
barrels cocked. Boggs throws up both of his hands and says, "O
Lord, don't shoot!" &nbsp;Bang! goes the first shot, and he
staggers back, clawing at the air&mdash;bang! goes the second one,
and he tumbles backwards on to the ground, heavy and solid, with
his arms spread out. &nbsp;That young girl screamed out and comes
rushing, and down she throws herself on her father, crying, and
saying, "Oh, he's killed him, he's killed him!" &nbsp;The crowd
closed up around them, and shouldered and jammed one another, with
their necks stretched, trying to see, and people on the inside
trying to shove them back and shouting, "Back, back! give him air,
give him air!"</p>

<br />
<br />
<br />
<p>Colonel Sherburn he tossed his pistol on to the ground, and
turned around on his heels and walked off.</p>
<p>They took Boggs to a little drug store, the crowd pressing
around just the same, and the whole town following, and I rushed
and got a good place at the window, where I was close to him and
could see in. &nbsp;They laid him on the floor and put one large
Bible under his head, and opened another one and spread it on his
breast; but they tore open his shirt first, and I seen where one of
the bullets went in. &nbsp;He made about a dozen long gasps, his
breast lifting the Bible up when he drawed in his breath, and
letting it down again when he breathed it out&mdash;and after that
he laid still; he was dead. &nbsp;Then they pulled his daughter
away from him, screaming and crying, and took her off. &nbsp;She
was about sixteen, and very sweet and gentle looking, but awful
pale and scared.</p>
<p>Well, pretty soon the whole town was there, squirming and
scrouging and pushing and shoving to get at the window and have a
look, but people that had the places wouldn't give them up, and
folks behind them was saying all the time, "Say, now, you've looked
enough, you fellows; 'tain't right and 'tain't fair for you to stay
thar all the time, and never give nobody a chance; other folks has
their rights as well as you."</p>
<p>There was considerable jawing back, so I slid out, thinking
maybe there was going to be trouble. &nbsp;The streets was full,
and everybody was excited. Everybody that seen the shooting was
telling how it happened, and there was a big crowd packed around
each one of these fellows, stretching their necks and listening.
&nbsp;One long, lanky man, with long hair and a big white fur
stovepipe hat on the back of his head, and a crooked-handled cane,
marked out the places on the ground where Boggs stood and where
Sherburn stood, and the people following him around from one place
to t'other and watching everything he done, and bobbing their heads
to show they understood, and stooping a little and resting their
hands on their thighs to watch him mark the places on the ground
with his cane; and then he stood up straight and stiff where
Sherburn had stood, frowning and having his hat-brim down over his
eyes, and sung out, "Boggs!" and then fetched his cane down slow to
a level, and says "Bang!" staggered backwards, says "Bang!" again,
and fell down flat on his back. The people that had seen the thing
said he done it perfect; said it was just exactly the way it all
happened. &nbsp;Then as much as a dozen people got out their
bottles and treated him.</p>
<p>Well, by and by somebody said Sherburn ought to be lynched.
&nbsp;In about a minute everybody was saying it; so away they went,
mad and yelling, and snatching down every clothes-line they come to
to do the hanging with.</p>

CHAPTER XXII.</p>
<p>THEY swarmed up towards Sherburn's house, a-whooping and raging
like Injuns, and everything had to clear the way or get run over
and tromped to mush, and it was awful to see. &nbsp;Children was
heeling it ahead of the mob, screaming and trying to get out of the
way; and every window along the road was full of women's heads, and
there was nigger boys in every tree, and bucks and wenches looking
over every fence; and as soon as the mob would get nearly to them
they would break and skaddle back out of reach. &nbsp;Lots of the
women and girls was crying and taking on, scared most to death.</p>
<p>They swarmed up in front of Sherburn's palings as thick as they
could jam together, and you couldn't hear yourself think for the
noise. &nbsp;It was a little twenty-foot yard. &nbsp;Some sung out
"Tear down the fence! tear down the fence!" &nbsp;Then there was a
racket of ripping and tearing and smashing, and down she goes, and
the front wall of the crowd begins to roll in like a wave.</p>
<p>Just then Sherburn steps out on to the roof of his little front
porch, with a double-barrel gun in his hand, and takes his stand,
perfectly ca'm and deliberate, not saying a word. &nbsp;The racket
stopped, and the wave sucked back.</p>
<p>Sherburn never said a word&mdash;just stood there, looking down.
&nbsp;The stillness was awful creepy and uncomfortable.
&nbsp;Sherburn run his eye slow along the crowd; and wherever it
struck the people tried a little to out-gaze him, but they
couldn't; they dropped their eyes and looked sneaky. Then pretty
soon Sherburn sort of laughed; not the pleasant kind, but the kind
that makes you feel like when you are eating bread that's got sand
in it.</p>
<p>Then he says, slow and scornful:</p>
<p>"The idea of YOU lynching anybody! &nbsp;It's amusing. &nbsp;The
idea of you thinking you had pluck enough to lynch a MAN!
&nbsp;Because you're brave enough to tar and feather poor
friendless cast-out women that come along here, did that make you
think you had grit enough to lay your hands on a MAN? &nbsp;Why, a
MAN'S safe in the hands of ten thousand of your kind&mdash;as long
as it's daytime and you're not behind him.</p>
<p>"Do I know you? &nbsp;I know you clear through was born and
raised in the South, and I've lived in the North; so I know the
average all around. The average man's a coward. &nbsp;In the North
he lets anybody walk over him that wants to, and goes home and
prays for a humble spirit to bear it. In the South one man all by
himself, has stopped a stage full of men in the daytime, and robbed
the lot. &nbsp;Your newspapers call you a brave people so much that
you think you are braver than any other people&mdash;whereas you're
just AS brave, and no braver. &nbsp;Why don't your juries hang
murderers? &nbsp;Because they're afraid the man's friends will
shoot them in the back, in the dark&mdash;and it's just what they
WOULD do.</p>
<p>"So they always acquit; and then a MAN goes in the night, with a
hundred masked cowards at his back and lynches the rascal.
&nbsp;Your mistake is, that you didn't bring a man with you; that's
one mistake, and the other is that you didn't come in the dark and
fetch your masks. &nbsp;You brought PART of a man&mdash;Buck
Harkness, there&mdash;and if you hadn't had him to start you, you'd
a taken it out in blowing.</p>
<p>"You didn't want to come. &nbsp;The average man don't like
trouble and danger. YOU don't like trouble and danger. &nbsp;But if
only HALF a man&mdash;like Buck Harkness, there&mdash;shouts 'Lynch
him! lynch him!' you're afraid to back down&mdash;afraid you'll be
found out to be what you are&mdash;COWARDS&mdash;and so you raise a
yell, and hang yourselves on to that half-a-man's coat-tail, and
come raging up here, swearing what big things you're going to do.
The pitifulest thing out is a mob; that's what an army is&mdash;a
mob; they don't fight with courage that's born in them, but with
courage that's borrowed from their mass, and from their officers.
&nbsp;But a mob without any MAN at the head of it is BENEATH
pitifulness. &nbsp;Now the thing for YOU to do is to droop your
tails and go home and crawl in a hole. &nbsp;If any real lynching's
going to be done it will be done in the dark, Southern fashion; and
when they come they'll bring their masks, and fetch a MAN along.
&nbsp;Now LEAVE&mdash;and take your half-a-man with
you"&mdash;tossing his gun up across his left arm and cocking it
when he says this.</p>
<p>The crowd washed back sudden, and then broke all apart, and went
tearing off every which way, and Buck Harkness he heeled it after
them, looking tolerable cheap. &nbsp;I could a stayed if I wanted
to, but I didn't want to.</p>
<p>I went to the circus and loafed around the back side till the
watchman went by, and then dived in under the tent. &nbsp;I had my
twenty-dollar gold piece and some other money, but I reckoned I
better save it, because there ain't no telling how soon you are
going to need it, away from home and amongst strangers that way.
&nbsp;You can't be too careful. &nbsp;I ain't opposed to spending
money on circuses when there ain't no other way, but there ain't no
use in WASTING it on them.</p>

<br />
<br />
<br />
<p>It was a real bully circus. &nbsp;It was the splendidest sight
that ever was when they all come riding in, two and two, a
gentleman and lady, side by side, the men just in their drawers and
undershirts, and no shoes nor stirrups, and resting their hands on
their thighs easy and comfortable&mdash;there must a been twenty of
them&mdash;and every lady with a lovely complexion, and perfectly
beautiful, and looking just like a gang of real sure-enough queens,
and dressed in clothes that cost millions of dollars, and just
littered with diamonds. &nbsp;It was a powerful fine sight; I never
see anything so lovely. &nbsp;And then one by one they got up and
stood, and went a-weaving around the ring so gentle and wavy and
graceful, the men looking ever so tall and airy and straight, with
their heads bobbing and skimming along, away up there under the
tent-roof, and every lady's rose-leafy dress flapping soft and
silky around her hips, and she looking like the most loveliest
parasol.</p>
<p>And then faster and faster they went, all of them dancing, first
one foot out in the air and then the other, the horses leaning more
and more, and the ringmaster going round and round the center-pole,
cracking his whip and shouting "Hi!&mdash;hi!" and the clown
cracking jokes behind him; and by and by all hands dropped the
reins, and every lady put her knuckles on her hips and every
gentleman folded his arms, and then how the horses did lean over
and hump themselves! &nbsp;And so one after the other they all
skipped off into the ring, and made the sweetest bow I ever see,
and then scampered out, and everybody clapped their hands and went
just about wild.</p>
<p>Well, all through the circus they done the most astonishing
things; and all the time that clown carried on so it most killed
the people. &nbsp;The ringmaster couldn't ever say a word to him
but he was back at him quick as a wink with the funniest things a
body ever said; and how he ever COULD think of so many of them, and
so sudden and so pat, was what I couldn't noway understand. Why, I
couldn't a thought of them in a year. And by and by a drunk man
tried to get into the ring&mdash;said he wanted to ride; said he
could ride as well as anybody that ever was. &nbsp;They argued and
tried to keep him out, but he wouldn't listen, and the whole show
come to a standstill. &nbsp;Then the people begun to holler at him
and make fun of him, and that made him mad, and he begun to rip and
tear; so that stirred up the people, and a lot of men begun to pile
down off of the benches and swarm towards the ring, saying, "Knock
him down! throw him out!" and one or two women begun to scream.
&nbsp;So, then, the ringmaster he made a little speech, and said he
hoped there wouldn't be no disturbance, and if the man would
promise he wouldn't make no more trouble he would let him ride if
he thought he could stay on the horse. &nbsp;So everybody laughed
and said all right, and the man got on. The minute he was on, the
horse begun to rip and tear and jump and cavort around, with two
circus men hanging on to his bridle trying to hold him, and the
drunk man hanging on to his neck, and his heels flying in the air
every jump, and the whole crowd of people standing up shouting and
laughing till tears rolled down. &nbsp;And at last, sure enough,
all the circus men could do, the horse broke loose, and away he
went like the very nation, round and round the ring, with that sot
laying down on him and hanging to his neck, with first one leg
hanging most to the ground on one side, and then t'other one on
t'other side, and the people just crazy. &nbsp;It warn't funny to
me, though; I was all of a tremble to see his danger. &nbsp;But
pretty soon he struggled up astraddle and grabbed the bridle,
a-reeling this way and that; and the next minute he sprung up and
dropped the bridle and stood! and the horse a-going like a house
afire too. &nbsp;He just stood up there, a-sailing around as easy
and comfortable as if he warn't ever drunk in his life&mdash;and
then he begun to pull off his clothes and sling them. &nbsp;He shed
them so thick they kind of clogged up the air, and altogether he
shed seventeen suits. And, then, there he was, slim and handsome,
and dressed the gaudiest and prettiest you ever saw, and he lit
into that horse with his whip and made him fairly hum&mdash;and
finally skipped off, and made his bow and danced off to the
dressing-room, and everybody just a-howling with pleasure and
astonishment.</p>

<br />
<br />
<p>Then the ringmaster he see how he had been fooled, and he WAS
the sickest ringmaster you ever see, I reckon. &nbsp;Why, it was
one of his own men! &nbsp;He had got up that joke all out of his
own head, and never let on to nobody. Well, I felt sheepish enough
to be took in so, but I wouldn't a been in that ringmaster's place,
not for a thousand dollars. &nbsp;I don't know; there may be
bullier circuses than what that one was, but I never struck them
yet. Anyways, it was plenty good enough for ME; and wherever I run
across it, it can have all of MY custom every time.</p>
<p>Well, that night we had OUR show; but there warn't only about
twelve people there&mdash;just enough to pay expenses. &nbsp;And
they laughed all the time, and that made the duke mad; and
everybody left, anyway, before the show was over, but one boy which
was asleep. &nbsp;So the duke said these Arkansaw lunkheads
couldn't come up to Shakespeare; what they wanted was low
comedy&mdash;and maybe something ruther worse than low comedy, he
reckoned. &nbsp;He said he could size their style. &nbsp;So next
morning he got some big sheets of wrapping paper and some black
paint, and drawed off some handbills, and stuck them up all over
the village. &nbsp;The bills said:</p>

CHAPTER XXIII.</p>
<p>WELL, all day him and the king was hard at it, rigging up a
stage and a curtain and a row of candles for footlights; and that
night the house was jam full of men in no time. &nbsp;When the
place couldn't hold no more, the duke he quit tending door and went
around the back way and come on to the stage and stood up before
the curtain and made a little speech, and praised up this tragedy,
and said it was the most thrillingest one that ever was; and so he
went on a-bragging about the tragedy, and about Edmund Kean the
Elder, which was to play the main principal part in it; and at last
when he'd got everybody's expectations up high enough, he rolled up
the curtain, and the next minute the king come a-prancing out on
all fours, naked; and he was painted all over,
ring-streaked-and-striped, all sorts of colors, as splendid as a
rainbow. &nbsp;And&mdash;but never mind the rest of his outfit; it
was just wild, but it was awful funny. The people most killed
themselves laughing; and when the king got done capering and
capered off behind the scenes, they roared and clapped and stormed
and haw-hawed till he come back and done it over again, and after
that they made him do it another time. Well, it would make a cow
laugh to see the shines that old idiot cut.</p>
<p>Then the duke he lets the curtain down, and bows to the people,
and says the great tragedy will be performed only two nights more,
on accounts of pressing London engagements, where the seats is all
sold already for it in Drury Lane; and then he makes them another
bow, and says if he has succeeded in pleasing them and instructing
them, he will be deeply obleeged if they will mention it to their
friends and get them to come and see it.</p>
<p>Twenty people sings out:</p>
<p>"What, is it over? &nbsp;Is that ALL?"</p>
<p>The duke says yes. &nbsp;Then there was a fine time.
&nbsp;Everybody sings out, "Sold!" and rose up mad, and was a-going
for that stage and them tragedians. &nbsp;But a big, fine looking
man jumps up on a bench and shouts:</p>
<p>"Hold on! &nbsp;Just a word, gentlemen." &nbsp;They stopped to
listen. &nbsp;"We are sold&mdash;mighty badly sold. &nbsp;But we
don't want to be the laughing stock of this whole town, I reckon,
and never hear the last of this thing as long as we live. &nbsp;NO.
&nbsp;What we want is to go out of here quiet, and talk this show
up, and sell the REST of the town! &nbsp;Then we'll all be in the
same boat. &nbsp;Ain't that sensible?" ("You bet it is!&mdash;the
jedge is right!" everybody sings out.) "All right, then&mdash;not a
word about any sell. &nbsp;Go along home, and advise everybody to
come and see the tragedy."</p>
<p>Next day you couldn't hear nothing around that town but how
splendid that show was. &nbsp;House was jammed again that night,
and we sold this crowd the same way. &nbsp;When me and the king and
the duke got home to the raft we all had a supper; and by and by,
about midnight, they made Jim and me back her out and float her
down the middle of the river, and fetch her in and hide her about
two mile below town.</p>
<p>The third night the house was crammed again&mdash;and they
warn't new-comers this time, but people that was at the show the
other two nights. &nbsp;I stood by the duke at the door, and I see
that every man that went in had his pockets bulging, or something
muffled up under his coat&mdash;and I see it warn't no perfumery,
neither, not by a long sight. &nbsp;I smelt sickly eggs by the
barrel, and rotten cabbages, and such things; and if I know the
signs of a dead cat being around, and I bet I do, there was
sixty-four of them went in. &nbsp;I shoved in there for a minute,
but it was too various for me; I couldn't stand it. &nbsp;Well,
when the place couldn't hold no more people the duke he give a
fellow a quarter and told him to tend door for him a minute, and
then he started around for the stage door, I after him; but the
minute we turned the corner and was in the dark he says:</p>
<p>"Walk fast now till you get away from the houses, and then shin
for the raft like the dickens was after you!"</p>
<p>I done it, and he done the same. &nbsp;We struck the raft at the
same time, and in less than two seconds we was gliding down stream,
all dark and still, and edging towards the middle of the river,
nobody saying a word. I reckoned the poor king was in for a gaudy
time of it with the audience, but nothing of the sort; pretty soon
he crawls out from under the wigwam, and says:</p>
<p>"Well, how'd the old thing pan out this time, duke?" &nbsp;He
hadn't been up-town at all.</p>
<p>We never showed a light till we was about ten mile below the
village. Then we lit up and had a supper, and the king and the duke
fairly laughed their bones loose over the way they'd served them
people. &nbsp;The duke says:</p>
<p>"Greenhorns, flatheads! &nbsp;I knew the first house would keep
mum and let the rest of the town get roped in; and I knew they'd
lay for us the third night, and consider it was THEIR turn now.
&nbsp;Well, it IS their turn, and I'd give something to know how
much they'd take for it. &nbsp;I WOULD just like to know how
they're putting in their opportunity. &nbsp;They can turn it into a
picnic if they want to&mdash;they brought plenty provisions."</p>
<p>Them rapscallions took in four hundred and sixty-five dollars in
that three nights. &nbsp;I never see money hauled in by the
wagon-load like that before. &nbsp;By and by, when they was asleep
and snoring, Jim says:</p>

<p>"Don't it s'prise you de way dem kings carries on, Huck?"</p>
<p>"No," I says, "it don't."</p>
<p>"Why don't it, Huck?"</p>
<p>"Well, it don't, because it's in the breed. &nbsp;I reckon
they're all alike,"</p>
<p>"But, Huck, dese kings o' ourn is reglar rapscallions; dat's
jist what dey is; dey's reglar rapscallions."</p>
<p>"Well, that's what I'm a-saying; all kings is mostly
rapscallions, as fur as I can make out."</p>
<p>"Is dat so?"</p>
<p>"You read about them once&mdash;you'll see. &nbsp;Look at Henry
the Eight; this 'n 's a Sunday-school Superintendent to HIM.
&nbsp;And look at Charles Second, and Louis Fourteen, and Louis
Fifteen, and James Second, and Edward Second, and Richard Third,
and forty more; besides all them Saxon heptarchies that used to rip
around so in old times and raise Cain. &nbsp;My, you ought to seen
old Henry the Eight when he was in bloom. &nbsp;He WAS a blossom.
&nbsp;He used to marry a new wife every day, and chop off her head
next morning. &nbsp;And he would do it just as indifferent as if he
was ordering up eggs. &nbsp;'Fetch up Nell Gwynn,' he says.
&nbsp;They fetch her up. Next morning, 'Chop off her head!'
&nbsp;And they chop it off. &nbsp;'Fetch up Jane Shore,' he says;
and up she comes, Next morning, 'Chop off her head'&mdash;and they
chop it off. &nbsp;'Ring up Fair Rosamun.' &nbsp;Fair Rosamun
answers the bell. &nbsp;Next morning, 'Chop off her head.'
&nbsp;And he made every one of them tell him a tale every night;
and he kept that up till he had hogged a thousand and one tales
that way, and then he put them all in a book, and called it
Domesday Book&mdash;which was a good name and stated the case.
&nbsp;You don't know kings, Jim, but I know them; and this old rip
of ourn is one of the cleanest I've struck in history. &nbsp;Well,
Henry he takes a notion he wants to get up some trouble with this
country. How does he go at it&mdash;give notice?&mdash;give the
country a show? &nbsp;No. &nbsp;All of a sudden he heaves all the
tea in Boston Harbor overboard, and whacks out a declaration of
independence, and dares them to come on. &nbsp;That was HIS
style&mdash;he never give anybody a chance. &nbsp;He had suspicions
of his father, the Duke of Wellington. &nbsp;Well, what did he do?
&nbsp;Ask him to show up? &nbsp;No&mdash;drownded him in a butt of
mamsey, like a cat. &nbsp;S'pose people left money laying around
where he was&mdash;what did he do? &nbsp;He collared it.
&nbsp;S'pose he contracted to do a thing, and you paid him, and
didn't set down there and see that he done it&mdash;what did he do?
&nbsp;He always done the other thing. S'pose he opened his
mouth&mdash;what then? &nbsp;If he didn't shut it up powerful quick
he'd lose a lie every time. &nbsp;That's the kind of a bug Henry
was; and if we'd a had him along 'stead of our kings he'd a fooled
that town a heap worse than ourn done. &nbsp;I don't say that ourn
is lambs, because they ain't, when you come right down to the cold
facts; but they ain't nothing to THAT old ram, anyway. &nbsp;All I
say is, kings is kings, and you got to make allowances. &nbsp;Take
them all around, they're a mighty ornery lot. It's the way they're
raised."</p>

<p>"But dis one do SMELL so like de nation, Huck."</p>
<p>"Well, they all do, Jim. &nbsp;We can't help the way a king
smells; history don't tell no way."</p>
<p>"Now de duke, he's a tolerble likely man in some ways."</p>
<p>"Yes, a duke's different. &nbsp;But not very different.
&nbsp;This one's a middling hard lot for a duke. &nbsp;When he's
drunk there ain't no near-sighted man could tell him from a
king."</p>
<p>"Well, anyways, I doan' hanker for no mo' un um, Huck.
&nbsp;Dese is all I kin stan'."</p>
<p>"It's the way I feel, too, Jim. &nbsp;But we've got them on our
hands, and we got to remember what they are, and make allowances.
&nbsp;Sometimes I wish we could hear of a country that's out of
kings."</p>
<p>What was the use to tell Jim these warn't real kings and dukes?
&nbsp;It wouldn't a done no good; and, besides, it was just as I
said: &nbsp;you couldn't tell them from the real kind.</p>
<p>I went to sleep, and Jim didn't call me when it was my turn.
&nbsp;He often done that. &nbsp;When I waked up just at daybreak he
was sitting there with his head down betwixt his knees, moaning and
mourning to himself. &nbsp;I didn't take notice nor let on. &nbsp;I
knowed what it was about. &nbsp;He was thinking about his wife and
his children, away up yonder, and he was low and homesick; because
he hadn't ever been away from home before in his life; and I do
believe he cared just as much for his people as white folks does
for their'n. &nbsp;It don't seem natural, but I reckon it's so.
&nbsp;He was often moaning and mourning that way nights, when he
judged I was asleep, and saying, "Po' little 'Lizabeth! po' little
Johnny! it's mighty hard; I spec' I ain't ever gwyne to see you no
mo', no mo'!" &nbsp;He was a mighty good nigger, Jim was.</p>
<p>But this time I somehow got to talking to him about his wife and
young ones; and by and by he says:</p>
<p>"What makes me feel so bad dis time 'uz bekase I hear sumpn over
yonder on de bank like a whack, er a slam, while ago, en it mine me
er de time I treat my little 'Lizabeth so ornery. &nbsp;She warn't

<p>"She never done it; jis' stood dah, kiner smilin' up at me.
&nbsp;It make me mad; en I says agin, mighty loud, I says:</p>
<p>"'Doan' you hear me? &nbsp;Shet de do'!'</p>
<p>"She jis stood de same way, kiner smilin' up. &nbsp;I was

CHAPTER XXIV.</p>
<p>NEXT day, towards night, we laid up under a little willow
towhead out in the middle, where there was a village on each side
of the river, and the duke and the king begun to lay out a plan for
working them towns. &nbsp;Jim he spoke to the duke, and said he
hoped it wouldn't take but a few hours, because it got mighty heavy
and tiresome to him when he had to lay all day in the wigwam tied
with the rope. &nbsp;You see, when we left him all alone we had to
tie him, because if anybody happened on to him all by himself and
not tied it wouldn't look much like he was a runaway nigger, you
know. So the duke said it WAS kind of hard to have to lay roped all
day, and he'd cipher out some way to get around it.</p>
<p>He was uncommon bright, the duke was, and he soon struck it.
&nbsp;He dressed Jim up in King Lear's outfit&mdash;it was a long
curtain-calico gown, and a white horse-hair wig and whiskers; and
then he took his theater paint and painted Jim's face and hands and
ears and neck all over a dead, dull, solid blue, like a man that's
been drownded nine days. &nbsp;Blamed if he warn't the horriblest
looking outrage I ever see. &nbsp;Then the duke took and wrote out
a sign on a shingle so:</p>
<p>Sick Arab&mdash;but harmless when not out of his head.</p>
<p>And he nailed that shingle to a lath, and stood the lath up four
or five foot in front of the wigwam. &nbsp;Jim was satisfied.
&nbsp;He said it was a sight better than lying tied a couple of
years every day, and trembling all over every time there was a
sound. &nbsp;The duke told him to make himself free and easy, and
if anybody ever come meddling around, he must hop out of the
wigwam, and carry on a little, and fetch a howl or two like a wild
beast, and he reckoned they would light out and leave him alone.
&nbsp;Which was sound enough judgment; but you take the average
man, and he wouldn't wait for him to howl. &nbsp;Why, he didn't
only look like he was dead, he looked considerable more than
that.</p>
<p>These rapscallions wanted to try the Nonesuch again, because
there was so much money in it, but they judged it wouldn't be safe,
because maybe the news might a worked along down by this time.
&nbsp;They couldn't hit no project that suited exactly; so at last
the duke said he reckoned he'd lay off and work his brains an hour
or two and see if he couldn't put up something on the Arkansaw
village; and the king he allowed he would drop over to t'other
village without any plan, but just trust in Providence to lead him
the profitable way&mdash;meaning the devil, I reckon. &nbsp;We had
all bought store clothes where we stopped last; and now the king
put his'n on, and he told me to put mine on. &nbsp;I done it, of
course. &nbsp;The king's duds was all black, and he did look real
swell and starchy. &nbsp;I never knowed how clothes could change a
body before. &nbsp;Why, before, he looked like the orneriest old
rip that ever was; but now, when he'd take off his new white beaver
and make a bow and do a smile, he looked that grand and good and
pious that you'd say he had walked right out of the ark, and maybe
was old Leviticus himself. &nbsp;Jim cleaned up the canoe, and I
got my paddle ready. &nbsp;There was a big steamboat laying at the
shore away up under the point, about three mile above the
town&mdash;been there a couple of hours, taking on freight.
&nbsp;Says the king:</p>
<p>"Seein' how I'm dressed, I reckon maybe I better arrive down
from St. Louis or Cincinnati, or some other big place. &nbsp;Go for
the steamboat, Huckleberry; we'll come down to the village on
her."</p>
<p>I didn't have to be ordered twice to go and take a steamboat
ride. &nbsp;I fetched the shore a half a mile above the village,
and then went scooting along the bluff bank in the easy water.
&nbsp;Pretty soon we come to a nice innocent-looking young country
jake setting on a log swabbing the sweat off of his face, for it
was powerful warm weather; and he had a couple of big carpet-bags
by him.</p>
<p>"Run her nose in shore," says the king. &nbsp;I done it.
&nbsp;"Wher' you bound for, young man?"</p>
<p>"For the steamboat; going to Orleans."</p>
<p>"Git aboard," says the king. &nbsp;"Hold on a minute, my servant
'll he'p you with them bags. &nbsp;Jump out and he'p the gentleman,
Adolphus"&mdash;meaning me, I see.</p>
<br />

<img alt="c24-205.jpg (40K)" src="images/c24-205.jpg" height="434"
width="543" /><br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<p>I done so, and then we all three started on again. &nbsp;The
young chap was mighty thankful; said it was tough work toting his
baggage such weather. He asked the king where he was going, and the
king told him he'd come down the river and landed at the other
village this morning, and now he was going up a few mile to see an
old friend on a farm up there. &nbsp;The young fellow says:</p>
<p>"When I first see you I says to myself, 'It's Mr. Wilks, sure,
and he come mighty near getting here in time.' &nbsp;But then I
says again, 'No, I reckon it ain't him, or else he wouldn't be
paddling up the river.' &nbsp;You AIN'T him, are you?"</p>
<p>"No, my name's Blodgett&mdash;Elexander Blodgett&mdash;REVEREND
Elexander Blodgett, I s'pose I must say, as I'm one o' the Lord's
poor servants. &nbsp;But still I'm jist as able to be sorry for Mr.
Wilks for not arriving in time, all the same, if he's missed
anything by it&mdash;which I hope he hasn't."</p>
<p>"Well, he don't miss any property by it, because he'll get that
all right; but he's missed seeing his brother Peter die&mdash;which
he mayn't mind, nobody can tell as to that&mdash;but his brother
would a give anything in this world to see HIM before he died;
never talked about nothing else all these three weeks; hadn't seen
him since they was boys together&mdash;and hadn't ever seen his
brother William at all&mdash;that's the deef and dumb
one&mdash;William ain't more than thirty or thirty-five.
&nbsp;Peter and George were the only ones that come out here;
George was the married brother; him and his wife both died last
year. &nbsp;Harvey and William's the only ones that's left now;
and, as I was saying, they haven't got here in time."</p>
<p>"Did anybody send 'em word?"</p>
<p>"Oh, yes; a month or two ago, when Peter was first took; because
Peter said then that he sorter felt like he warn't going to get
well this time. You see, he was pretty old, and George's g'yirls
was too young to be much company for him, except Mary Jane, the
red-headed one; and so he was kinder lonesome after George and his
wife died, and didn't seem to care much to live. &nbsp;He most
desperately wanted to see Harvey&mdash;and William, too, for that
matter&mdash;because he was one of them kind that can't bear to
make a will. &nbsp;He left a letter behind for Harvey, and said
he'd told in it where his money was hid, and how he wanted the rest
of the property divided up so George's g'yirls would be all
right&mdash;for George didn't leave nothing. &nbsp;And that letter
was all they could get him to put a pen to."</p>
<p>"Why do you reckon Harvey don't come? &nbsp;Wher' does he
live?"</p>
<p>"Oh, he lives in England&mdash;Sheffield&mdash;preaches
there&mdash;hasn't ever been in this country. &nbsp;He hasn't had
any too much time&mdash;and besides he mightn't a got the letter at
all, you know."</p>
<p>"Too bad, too bad he couldn't a lived to see his brothers, poor
soul. You going to Orleans, you say?"</p>
<p>"Yes, but that ain't only a part of it. &nbsp;I'm going in a
ship, next Wednesday, for Ryo Janeero, where my uncle lives."</p>
<p>"It's a pretty long journey. &nbsp;But it'll be lovely; wisht I
was a-going. Is Mary Jane the oldest? &nbsp;How old is the
others?"</p>
<p>"Mary Jane's nineteen, Susan's fifteen, and Joanna's about
fourteen&mdash;that's the one that gives herself to good works and
has a hare-lip."</p>
<p>"Poor things! to be left alone in the cold world so."</p>
<p>"Well, they could be worse off. &nbsp;Old Peter had friends, and
they ain't going to let them come to no harm. &nbsp;There's Hobson,
the Babtis' preacher; and Deacon Lot Hovey, and Ben Rucker, and
Abner Shackleford, and Levi Bell, the lawyer; and Dr. Robinson, and
their wives, and the widow Bartley, and&mdash;well, there's a lot
of them; but these are the ones that Peter was thickest with, and
used to write about sometimes, when he wrote home; so Harvey 'll
know where to look for friends when he gets here."</p>
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<a name="c24-207" id="c24-207"></a><br />
<br />
<img alt="c24-207.jpg (71K)" src="images/c24-207.jpg" height="451"
width="637" /><br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<p>Well, the old man went on asking questions till he just fairly
emptied that young fellow. &nbsp;Blamed if he didn't inquire about
everybody and everything in that blessed town, and all about the
Wilkses; and about Peter's business&mdash;which was a tanner; and
about George's&mdash;which was a carpenter; and about
Harvey's&mdash;which was a dissentering minister; and so on, and so
on. &nbsp;Then he says:</p>
<p>"What did you want to walk all the way up to the steamboat
for?"</p>
<p>"Because she's a big Orleans boat, and I was afeard she mightn't
stop there. &nbsp;When they're deep they won't stop for a hail.
&nbsp;A Cincinnati boat will, but this is a St. Louis one."</p>
<p>"Was Peter Wilks well off?"</p>
<p>"Oh, yes, pretty well off. &nbsp;He had houses and land, and
it's reckoned he left three or four thousand in cash hid up
som'ers."</p>
<p>"When did you say he died?"</p>
<p>"I didn't say, but it was last night."</p>
<p>"Funeral to-morrow, likely?"</p>
<p>"Yes, 'bout the middle of the day."</p>
<p>"Well, it's all terrible sad; but we've all got to go, one time
or another. So what we want to do is to be prepared; then we're all
right."</p>
<p>"Yes, sir, it's the best way. &nbsp;Ma used to always say
that."</p>
<p>When we struck the boat she was about done loading, and pretty
soon she got off. &nbsp;The king never said nothing about going
aboard, so I lost my ride, after all. &nbsp;When the boat was gone
the king made me paddle up another mile to a lonesome place, and
then he got ashore and says:</p>
<p>"Now hustle back, right off, and fetch the duke up here, and the
new carpet-bags. &nbsp;And if he's gone over to t'other side, go
over there and git him. &nbsp;And tell him to git himself up
regardless. &nbsp;Shove along, now."</p>
<p>I see what HE was up to; but I never said nothing, of course.
&nbsp;When I got back with the duke we hid the canoe, and then they
set down on a log, and the king told him everything, just like the
young fellow had said it&mdash;every last word of it. &nbsp;And all
the time he was a-doing it he tried to talk like an Englishman; and
he done it pretty well, too, for a slouch. I can't imitate him, and
so I ain't a-going to try to; but he really done it pretty good.
&nbsp;Then he says:</p>
<p>"How are you on the deef and dumb, Bilgewater?"</p>
<p>The duke said, leave him alone for that; said he had played a
deef and dumb person on the histronic boards. &nbsp;So then they
waited for a steamboat.</p>
<p>About the middle of the afternoon a couple of little boats come
along, but they didn't come from high enough up the river; but at
last there was a big one, and they hailed her. &nbsp;She sent out
her yawl, and we went aboard, and she was from Cincinnati; and when
they found we only wanted to go four or five mile they was booming
mad, and gave us a cussing, and said they wouldn't land us.
&nbsp;But the king was ca'm. &nbsp;He says:</p>
<p>"If gentlemen kin afford to pay a dollar a mile apiece to be
took on and put off in a yawl, a steamboat kin afford to carry 'em,
can't it?"</p>
<p>So they softened down and said it was all right; and when we got
to the village they yawled us ashore. &nbsp;About two dozen men
flocked down when they see the yawl a-coming, and when the king
says:</p>
<p>"Kin any of you gentlemen tell me wher' Mr. Peter Wilks lives?"
they give a glance at one another, and nodded their heads, as much
as to say, "What d' I tell you?" &nbsp;Then one of them says, kind
of soft and gentle:</p>
<p>"I'm sorry sir, but the best we can do is to tell you where he
DID live yesterday evening."</p>
<p>Sudden as winking the ornery old cretur went an to smash, and
fell up against the man, and put his chin on his shoulder, and
cried down his back, and says:</p>
<p>"Alas, alas, our poor brother&mdash;gone, and we never got to
see him; oh, it's too, too hard!"</p>

<br />
<br />
<br />
<p>Then he turns around, blubbering, and makes a lot of idiotic
signs to the duke on his hands, and blamed if he didn't drop a
carpet-bag and bust out a-crying. &nbsp;If they warn't the
beatenest lot, them two frauds, that ever I struck.</p>
<p>Well, the men gathered around and sympathized with them, and
said all sorts of kind things to them, and carried their
carpet-bags up the hill for them, and let them lean on them and
cry, and told the king all about his brother's last moments, and
the king he told it all over again on his hands to the duke, and
both of them took on about that dead tanner like they'd lost the
twelve disciples. &nbsp;Well, if ever I struck anything like it,
I'm a nigger. It was enough to make a body ashamed of the human
race.</p>

CHAPTER XXV.</p>
<p>THE news was all over town in two minutes, and you could see the
people tearing down on the run from every which way, some of them
putting on their coats as they come. &nbsp;Pretty soon we was in
the middle of a crowd, and the noise of the tramping was like a
soldier march. &nbsp;The windows and dooryards was full; and every
minute somebody would say, over a fence:</p>
<p>"Is it THEM?"</p>
<p>And somebody trotting along with the gang would answer back and
say:</p>
<p>"You bet it is."</p>
<p>When we got to the house the street in front of it was packed,
and the three girls was standing in the door. &nbsp;Mary Jane WAS
red-headed, but that don't make no difference, she was most awful
beautiful, and her face and her eyes was all lit up like glory, she
was so glad her uncles was come. The king he spread his arms, and
Mary Jane she jumped for them, and the hare-lip jumped for the
duke, and there they HAD it! &nbsp;Everybody most, leastways women,
cried for joy to see them meet again at last and have such good
times.</p>
<p>Then the king he hunched the duke private&mdash;I see him do
it&mdash;and then he looked around and see the coffin, over in the
corner on two chairs; so then him and the duke, with a hand across
each other's shoulder, and t'other hand to their eyes, walked slow
and solemn over there, everybody dropping back to give them room,
and all the talk and noise stopping, people saying "Sh!" and all
the men taking their hats off and drooping their heads, so you
could a heard a pin fall. &nbsp;And when they got there they bent
over and looked in the coffin, and took one sight, and then they
bust out a-crying so you could a heard them to Orleans, most; and
then they put their arms around each other's necks, and hung their
chins over each other's shoulders; and then for three minutes, or
maybe four, I never see two men leak the way they done. &nbsp;And,
mind you, everybody was doing the same; and the place was that damp
I never see anything like it. Then one of them got on one side of
the coffin, and t'other on t'other side, and they kneeled down and
rested their foreheads on the coffin, and let on to pray all to
themselves. &nbsp;Well, when it come to that it worked the crowd
like you never see anything like it, and everybody broke down and
went to sobbing right out loud&mdash;the poor girls, too; and every
woman, nearly, went up to the girls, without saying a word, and
kissed them, solemn, on the forehead, and then put their hand on
their head, and looked up towards the sky, with the tears running
down, and then busted out and went off sobbing and swabbing, and
give the next woman a show. &nbsp;I never see anything so
disgusting.</p>
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<a name="c25-212" id="c25-212"></a><br />
<br />
<img alt="c25-212.jpg (44K)" src="images/c25-212.jpg" height="534"
width="374" /><br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<p>Well, by and by the king he gets up and comes forward a little,
and works himself up and slobbers out a speech, all full of tears
and flapdoodle about its being a sore trial for him and his poor
brother to lose the diseased, and to miss seeing diseased alive
after the long journey of four thousand mile, but it's a trial
that's sweetened and sanctified to us by this dear sympathy and
these holy tears, and so he thanks them out of his heart and out of
his brother's heart, because out of their mouths they can't, words
being too weak and cold, and all that kind of rot and slush, till
it was just sickening; and then he blubbers out a pious goody-goody
Amen, and turns himself loose and goes to crying fit to bust.</p>
<p>And the minute the words were out of his mouth somebody over in
the crowd struck up the doxolojer, and everybody joined in with all
their might, and it just warmed you up and made you feel as good as
church letting out. Music is a good thing; and after all that
soul-butter and hogwash I never see it freshen up things so, and
sound so honest and bully.</p>
<p>Then the king begins to work his jaw again, and says how him and
his nieces would be glad if a few of the main principal friends of
the family would take supper here with them this evening, and help
set up with the ashes of the diseased; and says if his poor brother
laying yonder could speak he knows who he would name, for they was
names that was very dear to him, and mentioned often in his
letters; and so he will name the same, to wit, as follows,
vizz.:&mdash;Rev. Mr. Hobson, and Deacon Lot Hovey, and Mr. Ben
Rucker, and Abner Shackleford, and Levi Bell, and Dr. Robinson, and
their wives, and the widow Bartley.</p>
<p>Rev. Hobson and Dr. Robinson was down to the end of the town
a-hunting together&mdash;that is, I mean the doctor was shipping a
sick man to t'other world, and the preacher was pinting him right.
&nbsp;Lawyer Bell was away up to Louisville on business. &nbsp;But
the rest was on hand, and so they all come and shook hands with the
king and thanked him and talked to him; and then they shook hands
with the duke and didn't say nothing, but just kept a-smiling and
bobbing their heads like a passel of sapheads whilst he made all
sorts of signs with his hands and said "Goo-goo&mdash;goo-goo-goo"
all the time, like a baby that can't talk.</p>
<p>So the king he blattered along, and managed to inquire about
pretty much everybody and dog in town, by his name, and mentioned
all sorts of little things that happened one time or another in the
town, or to George's family, or to Peter. &nbsp;And he always let
on that Peter wrote him the things; but that was a lie: &nbsp;he
got every blessed one of them out of that young flathead that we
canoed up to the steamboat.</p>
<p>Then Mary Jane she fetched the letter her father left behind,
and the king he read it out loud and cried over it. &nbsp;It give
the dwelling-house and three thousand dollars, gold, to the girls;
and it give the tanyard (which was doing a good business), along
with some other houses and land (worth about seven thousand), and
three thousand dollars in gold to Harvey and William, and told
where the six thousand cash was hid down cellar. &nbsp;So these two
frauds said they'd go and fetch it up, and have everything square
and above-board; and told me to come with a candle. &nbsp;We shut
the cellar door behind us, and when they found the bag they spilt
it out on the floor, and it was a lovely sight, all them
yaller-boys. &nbsp;My, the way the king's eyes did shine! &nbsp;He
slaps the duke on the shoulder and says:</p>
<p>"Oh, THIS ain't bully nor noth'n! &nbsp;Oh, no, I reckon not!
&nbsp;Why, Biljy, it beats the Nonesuch, DON'T it?"</p>
<p>The duke allowed it did. &nbsp;They pawed the yaller-boys, and
sifted them through their fingers and let them jingle down on the
floor; and the king says:</p>
<p>"It ain't no use talkin'; bein' brothers to a rich dead man and
representatives of furrin heirs that's got left is the line for you
and me, Bilge. &nbsp;Thish yer comes of trust'n to Providence.
&nbsp;It's the best way, in the long run. &nbsp;I've tried 'em all,
and ther' ain't no better way."</p>
<p>Most everybody would a been satisfied with the pile, and took it
on trust; but no, they must count it. &nbsp;So they counts it, and
it comes out four hundred and fifteen dollars short. &nbsp;Says the
king:</p>
<p>"Dern him, I wonder what he done with that four hundred and
fifteen dollars?"</p>
<p>They worried over that awhile, and ransacked all around for it.
&nbsp;Then the duke says:</p>
<p>"Well, he was a pretty sick man, and likely he made a
mistake&mdash;I reckon that's the way of it. &nbsp;The best way's
to let it go, and keep still about it. &nbsp;We can spare it."</p>
<p>"Oh, shucks, yes, we can SPARE it. &nbsp;I don't k'yer noth'n
'bout that&mdash;it's the COUNT I'm thinkin' about. &nbsp;We want
to be awful square and open and above-board here, you know.
&nbsp;We want to lug this h-yer money up stairs and count it before
everybody&mdash;then ther' ain't noth'n suspicious. &nbsp;But when
the dead man says ther's six thous'n dollars, you know, we don't
want to&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Hold on," says the duke. &nbsp;"Le's make up the deffisit," and
he begun to haul out yaller-boys out of his pocket.</p>

width="424" /><br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<p>"It's a most amaz'n' good idea, duke&mdash;you HAVE got a
rattlin' clever head on you," says the king. &nbsp;"Blest if the
old Nonesuch ain't a heppin' us out agin," and HE begun to haul out
yaller-jackets and stack them up.</p>
<p>It most busted them, but they made up the six thousand clean and
clear.</p>
<p>"Say," says the duke, "I got another idea. &nbsp;Le's go up
stairs and count this money, and then take and GIVE IT TO THE
GIRLS."</p>
<p>"Good land, duke, lemme hug you! &nbsp;It's the most dazzling
idea 'at ever a man struck. &nbsp;You have cert'nly got the most
astonishin' head I ever see. Oh, this is the boss dodge, ther'
ain't no mistake 'bout it. &nbsp;Let 'em fetch along their
suspicions now if they want to&mdash;this 'll lay 'em out."</p>
<p>When we got up-stairs everybody gethered around the table, and
the king he counted it and stacked it up, three hundred dollars in
a pile&mdash;twenty elegant little piles. &nbsp;Everybody looked
hungry at it, and licked their chops. &nbsp;Then they raked it into
the bag again, and I see the king begin to swell himself up for
another speech. &nbsp;He says:</p>
<p>"Friends all, my poor brother that lays yonder has done generous
by them that's left behind in the vale of sorrers. &nbsp;He has
done generous by these yer poor little lambs that he loved and
sheltered, and that's left fatherless and motherless. &nbsp;Yes,
and we that knowed him knows that he would a done MORE generous by
'em if he hadn't ben afeard o' woundin' his dear William and me.
&nbsp;Now, WOULDN'T he? &nbsp;Ther' ain't no question 'bout it in
MY mind. &nbsp;Well, then, what kind o' brothers would it be that
'd stand in his way at sech a time? &nbsp;And what kind o' uncles
would it be that 'd rob&mdash;yes, ROB&mdash;sech poor sweet lambs
as these 'at he loved so at sech a time? &nbsp;If I know
William&mdash;and I THINK I do&mdash;he&mdash;well, I'll jest ask
him." He turns around and begins to make a lot of signs to the duke
with his hands, and the duke he looks at him stupid and
leather-headed a while; then all of a sudden he seems to catch his
meaning, and jumps for the king, goo-gooing with all his might for
joy, and hugs him about fifteen times before he lets up. &nbsp;Then
the king says, "I knowed it; I reckon THAT 'll convince anybody the
way HE feels about it. &nbsp;Here, Mary Jane, Susan, Joanner, take
the money&mdash;take it ALL. &nbsp;It's the gift of him that lays
yonder, cold but joyful."</p>

<br />
<br />
<br />
<p>Mary Jane she went for him, Susan and the hare-lip went for the
duke, and then such another hugging and kissing I never see yet.
&nbsp;And everybody crowded up with the tears in their eyes, and
most shook the hands off of them frauds, saying all the time:</p>
<p>"You DEAR good souls!&mdash;how LOVELY!&mdash;how COULD
you!"</p>
<p>Well, then, pretty soon all hands got to talking about the
diseased again, and how good he was, and what a loss he was, and
all that; and before long a big iron-jawed man worked himself in
there from outside, and stood a-listening and looking, and not
saying anything; and nobody saying anything to him either, because
the king was talking and they was all busy listening. &nbsp;The
king was saying&mdash;in the middle of something he'd started in
on&mdash;</p>
<p>"&mdash;they bein' partickler friends o' the diseased.
&nbsp;That's why they're invited here this evenin'; but tomorrow we
want ALL to come&mdash;everybody; for he respected everybody, he
liked everybody, and so it's fitten that his funeral orgies sh'd be
public."</p>
<p>And so he went a-mooning on and on, liking to hear himself talk,
and every little while he fetched in his funeral orgies again, till
the duke he couldn't stand it no more; so he writes on a little
scrap of paper, "OBSEQUIES, you old fool," and folds it up, and
goes to goo-gooing and reaching it over people's heads to him.
&nbsp;The king he reads it and puts it in his pocket, and says:</p>
<p>"Poor William, afflicted as he is, his HEART'S aluz right.
&nbsp;Asks me to invite everybody to come to the
funeral&mdash;wants me to make 'em all welcome. &nbsp;But he
needn't a worried&mdash;it was jest what I was at."</p>
<p>Then he weaves along again, perfectly ca'm, and goes to dropping
in his funeral orgies again every now and then, just like he done
before. &nbsp;And when he done it the third time he says:</p>
<p>"I say orgies, not because it's the common term, because it
ain't&mdash;obsequies bein' the common term&mdash;but because
orgies is the right term. Obsequies ain't used in England no more
now&mdash;it's gone out. &nbsp;We say orgies now in England.
&nbsp;Orgies is better, because it means the thing you're after
more exact. &nbsp;It's a word that's made up out'n the Greek ORGO,
outside, open, abroad; and the Hebrew JEESUM, to plant, cover up;
hence inTER. &nbsp;So, you see, funeral orgies is an open er public
funeral."</p>
<p>He was the WORST I ever struck. &nbsp;Well, the iron-jawed man
he laughed right in his face. &nbsp;Everybody was shocked.
&nbsp;Everybody says, "Why, DOCTOR!" and Abner Shackleford
says:</p>
<p>"Why, Robinson, hain't you heard the news? &nbsp;This is Harvey
Wilks."</p>
<p>The king he smiled eager, and shoved out his flapper, and
says:</p>
<p>"Is it my poor brother's dear good friend and physician?
&nbsp;I&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Keep your hands off of me!" says the doctor. &nbsp;"YOU talk
like an Englishman, DON'T you? &nbsp;It's the worst imitation I
ever heard. &nbsp;YOU Peter Wilks's brother! &nbsp;You're a fraud,
that's what you are!"</p>

width="312" /><br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<p>Well, how they all took on! &nbsp;They crowded around the doctor
and tried to quiet him down, and tried to explain to him and tell
him how Harvey 'd showed in forty ways that he WAS Harvey, and
knowed everybody by name, and the names of the very dogs, and
begged and BEGGED him not to hurt Harvey's feelings and the poor
girl's feelings, and all that. &nbsp;But it warn't no use; he
stormed right along, and said any man that pretended to be an
Englishman and couldn't imitate the lingo no better than what he
did was a fraud and a liar. &nbsp;The poor girls was hanging to the
king and crying; and all of a sudden the doctor ups and turns on
THEM. &nbsp;He says:</p>
<p>"I was your father's friend, and I'm your friend; and I warn you
as a friend, and an honest one that wants to protect you and keep
you out of harm and trouble, to turn your backs on that scoundrel
and have nothing to do with him, the ignorant tramp, with his
idiotic Greek and Hebrew, as he calls it. &nbsp;He is the thinnest
kind of an impostor&mdash;has come here with a lot of empty names
and facts which he picked up somewheres, and you take them for
PROOFS, and are helped to fool yourselves by these foolish friends
here, who ought to know better. &nbsp;Mary Jane Wilks, you know me
for your friend, and for your unselfish friend, too. &nbsp;Now
listen to me; turn this pitiful rascal out&mdash;I BEG you to do
it. &nbsp;Will you?"</p>
<p>Mary Jane straightened herself up, and my, but she was handsome!
&nbsp;She says:</p>
<p>"HERE is my answer." &nbsp;She hove up the bag of money and put
it in the king's hands, and says, "Take this six thousand dollars,
and invest for me and my sisters any way you want to, and don't
give us no receipt for it."</p>
<p>Then she put her arm around the king on one side, and Susan and
the hare-lip done the same on the other. &nbsp;Everybody clapped
their hands and stomped on the floor like a perfect storm, whilst
the king held up his head and smiled proud. &nbsp;The doctor
says:</p>
<p>"All right; I wash MY hands of the matter. &nbsp;But I warn you
all that a time 's coming when you're going to feel sick whenever
you think of this day." And away he went.</p>
<p>"All right, doctor," says the king, kinder mocking him; "we'll
try and get 'em to send for you;" which made them all laugh, and
they said it was a prime good hit.</p>

CHAPTER XXVI.</p>
<p>WELL, when they was all gone the king he asks Mary Jane how they
was off for spare rooms, and she said she had one spare room, which
would do for Uncle William, and she'd give her own room to Uncle
Harvey, which was a little bigger, and she would turn into the room
with her sisters and sleep on a cot; and up garret was a little
cubby, with a pallet in it. The king said the cubby would do for
his valley&mdash;meaning me.</p>
<p>So Mary Jane took us up, and she showed them their rooms, which
was plain but nice. &nbsp;She said she'd have her frocks and a lot
of other traps took out of her room if they was in Uncle Harvey's
way, but he said they warn't. &nbsp;The frocks was hung along the
wall, and before them was a curtain made out of calico that hung
down to the floor. &nbsp;There was an old hair trunk in one corner,
and a guitar-box in another, and all sorts of little knickknacks
and jimcracks around, like girls brisken up a room with. &nbsp;The
king said it was all the more homely and more pleasanter for these
fixings, and so don't disturb them. &nbsp;The duke's room was
pretty small, but plenty good enough, and so was my cubby.</p>
<p>That night they had a big supper, and all them men and women was
there, and I stood behind the king and the duke's chairs and waited
on them, and the niggers waited on the rest. &nbsp;Mary Jane she
set at the head of the table, with Susan alongside of her, and said
how bad the biscuits was, and how mean the preserves was, and how
ornery and tough the fried chickens was&mdash;and all that kind of
rot, the way women always do for to force out compliments; and the
people all knowed everything was tiptop, and said so&mdash;said
"How DO you get biscuits to brown so nice?" and "Where, for the
land's sake, DID you get these amaz'n pickles?" and all that kind
of humbug talky-talk, just the way people always does at a supper,
you know.</p>
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<a name="c26-221" id="c26-221"></a><br />
<br />
<img alt="c26-221.jpg (54K)" src="images/c26-221.jpg" height="566"
width="444" /><br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<p>And when it was all done me and the hare-lip had supper in the
kitchen off of the leavings, whilst the others was helping the
niggers clean up the things. &nbsp;The hare-lip she got to pumping
me about England, and blest if I didn't think the ice was getting
mighty thin sometimes. &nbsp;She says:</p>
<p>"Did you ever see the king?"</p>
<p>"Who? &nbsp;William Fourth? &nbsp;Well, I bet I have&mdash;he
goes to our church." &nbsp;I knowed he was dead years ago, but I
never let on. &nbsp;So when I says he goes to our church, she
says:</p>
<p>"What&mdash;regular?"</p>
<p>"Yes&mdash;regular. &nbsp;His pew's right over opposite
ourn&mdash;on t'other side the pulpit."</p>
<p>"I thought he lived in London?"</p>
<p>"Well, he does. &nbsp;Where WOULD he live?"</p>
<p>"But I thought YOU lived in Sheffield?"</p>
<p>I see I was up a stump. &nbsp;I had to let on to get choked with
a chicken bone, so as to get time to think how to get down again.
&nbsp;Then I says:</p>
<p>"I mean he goes to our church regular when he's in Sheffield.
&nbsp;That's only in the summer time, when he comes there to take
the sea baths."</p>
<p>"Why, how you talk&mdash;Sheffield ain't on the sea."</p>
<p>"Well, who said it was?"</p>
<p>"Why, you did."</p>
<p>"I DIDN'T nuther."</p>
<p>"You did!"</p>
<p>"I didn't."</p>
<p>"You did."</p>
<p>"I never said nothing of the kind."</p>
<p>"Well, what DID you say, then?"</p>
<p>"Said he come to take the sea BATHS&mdash;that's what I
said."</p>
<p>"Well, then, how's he going to take the sea baths if it ain't on
the sea?"</p>
<p>"Looky here," I says; "did you ever see any Congress-water?"</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>"Well, did you have to go to Congress to get it?"</p>
<p>"Why, no."</p>
<p>"Well, neither does William Fourth have to go to the sea to get
a sea bath."</p>
<p>"How does he get it, then?"</p>
<p>"Gets it the way people down here gets Congress-water&mdash;in
barrels. &nbsp;There in the palace at Sheffield they've got
furnaces, and he wants his water hot. &nbsp;They can't bile that
amount of water away off there at the sea. They haven't got no
conveniences for it."</p>
<p>"Oh, I see, now. &nbsp;You might a said that in the first place
and saved time."</p>
<p>When she said that I see I was out of the woods again, and so I
was comfortable and glad. &nbsp;Next, she says:</p>
<p>"Do you go to church, too?"</p>
<p>"Yes&mdash;regular."</p>
<p>"Where do you set?"</p>
<p>"Why, in our pew."</p>
<p>"WHOSE pew?"</p>
<p>"Why, OURN&mdash;your Uncle Harvey's."</p>
<p>"His'n? &nbsp;What does HE want with a pew?"</p>
<p>"Wants it to set in. &nbsp;What did you RECKON he wanted with
it?"</p>
<p>"Why, I thought he'd be in the pulpit."</p>
<p>Rot him, I forgot he was a preacher. &nbsp;I see I was up a
stump again, so I played another chicken bone and got another
think. &nbsp;Then I says:</p>
<p>"Blame it, do you suppose there ain't but one preacher to a
church?"</p>
<p>"Why, what do they want with more?"</p>
<p>"What!&mdash;to preach before a king? &nbsp;I never did see such
a girl as you. They don't have no less than seventeen."</p>
<p>"Seventeen! &nbsp;My land! &nbsp;Why, I wouldn't set out such a
string as that, not if I NEVER got to glory. &nbsp;It must take 'em
a week."</p>
<p>"Shucks, they don't ALL of 'em preach the same day&mdash;only
ONE of 'em."</p>
<p>"Well, then, what does the rest of 'em do?"</p>
<p>"Oh, nothing much. &nbsp;Loll around, pass the plate&mdash;and
one thing or another. &nbsp;But mainly they don't do nothing."</p>
<p>"Well, then, what are they FOR?"</p>
<p>"Why, they're for STYLE. &nbsp;Don't you know nothing?"</p>
<p>"Well, I don't WANT to know no such foolishness as that.
&nbsp;How is servants treated in England? &nbsp;Do they treat 'em
better 'n we treat our niggers?"</p>
<p>"NO! &nbsp;A servant ain't nobody there. &nbsp;They treat them
worse than dogs."</p>
<p>"Don't they give 'em holidays, the way we do, Christmas and New
Year's week, and Fourth of July?"</p>
<p>"Oh, just listen! &nbsp;A body could tell YOU hain't ever been
to England by that. &nbsp;Why, Hare-l&mdash;why, Joanna, they never
see a holiday from year's end to year's end; never go to the
circus, nor theater, nor nigger shows, nor nowheres."</p>
<p>"Nor church?"</p>
<p>"Nor church."</p>
<p>"But YOU always went to church."</p>
<p>Well, I was gone up again. &nbsp;I forgot I was the old man's
servant. &nbsp;But next minute I whirled in on a kind of an
explanation how a valley was different from a common servant and
HAD to go to church whether he wanted to or not, and set with the
family, on account of its being the law. &nbsp;But I didn't do it
pretty good, and when I got done I see she warn't satisfied.
&nbsp;She says:</p>
<p>"Honest injun, now, hain't you been telling me a lot of
lies?"</p>
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<a name="c26-224" id="c26-224"></a><br />
<br />
<img alt="c26-224.jpg (63K)" src="images/c26-224.jpg" height="586"
width="432" /><br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<p>"Honest injun," says I.</p>
<p>"None of it at all?"</p>
<p>"None of it at all. &nbsp;Not a lie in it," says I.</p>
<p>"Lay your hand on this book and say it."</p>
<p>I see it warn't nothing but a dictionary, so I laid my hand on
it and said it. &nbsp;So then she looked a little better satisfied,
and says:</p>
<p>"Well, then, I'll believe some of it; but I hope to gracious if
I'll believe the rest."</p>
<p>"What is it you won't believe, Joe?" says Mary Jane, stepping in
with Susan behind her. &nbsp;"It ain't right nor kind for you to
talk so to him, and him a stranger and so far from his people.
&nbsp;How would you like to be treated so?"</p>
<p>"That's always your way, Maim&mdash;always sailing in to help
somebody before they're hurt. &nbsp;I hain't done nothing to him.
&nbsp;He's told some stretchers, I reckon, and I said I wouldn't
swallow it all; and that's every bit and grain I DID say. &nbsp;I
reckon he can stand a little thing like that, can't he?"</p>
<p>"I don't care whether 'twas little or whether 'twas big; he's
here in our house and a stranger, and it wasn't good of you to say
it. &nbsp;If you was in his place it would make you feel ashamed;
and so you oughtn't to say a thing to another person that will make
THEM feel ashamed."</p>
<p>"Why, Maim, he said&mdash;"</p>
<p>"It don't make no difference what he SAID&mdash;that ain't the
thing. &nbsp;The thing is for you to treat him KIND, and not be
saying things to make him remember he ain't in his own country and
amongst his own folks."</p>
<p>I says to myself, THIS is a girl that I'm letting that old
reptle rob her of her money!</p>
<p>Then Susan SHE waltzed in; and if you'll believe me, she did
give Hare-lip hark from the tomb!</p>
<p>Says I to myself, and this is ANOTHER one that I'm letting him
rob her of her money!</p>
<p>Then Mary Jane she took another inning, and went in sweet and
lovely again&mdash;which was her way; but when she got done there
warn't hardly anything left o' poor Hare-lip. &nbsp;So she
hollered.</p>
<p>"All right, then," says the other girls; "you just ask his
pardon."</p>
<p>She done it, too; and she done it beautiful. &nbsp;She done it
so beautiful it was good to hear; and I wished I could tell her a
thousand lies, so she could do it again.</p>
<p>I says to myself, this is ANOTHER one that I'm letting him rob
her of her money. &nbsp;And when she got through they all jest laid
theirselves out to make me feel at home and know I was amongst
friends. &nbsp;I felt so ornery and low down and mean that I says
to myself, my mind's made up; I'll hive that money for them or
bust.</p>
<p>So then I lit out&mdash;for bed, I said, meaning some time or
another. &nbsp;When I got by myself I went to thinking the thing
over. &nbsp;I says to myself, shall I go to that doctor, private,
and blow on these frauds? &nbsp;No&mdash;that won't do. He might
tell who told him; then the king and the duke would make it warm
for me. &nbsp;Shall I go, private, and tell Mary Jane?
&nbsp;No&mdash;I dasn't do it. Her face would give them a hint,
sure; they've got the money, and they'd slide right out and get
away with it. &nbsp;If she was to fetch in help I'd get mixed up in
the business before it was done with, I judge. &nbsp;No; there
ain't no good way but one. &nbsp;I got to steal that money,
somehow; and I got to steal it some way that they won't suspicion
that I done it. They've got a good thing here, and they ain't
a-going to leave till they've played this family and this town for
all they're worth, so I'll find a chance time enough. I'll steal it
and hide it; and by and by, when I'm away down the river, I'll
write a letter and tell Mary Jane where it's hid. &nbsp;But I
better hive it tonight if I can, because the doctor maybe hasn't
let up as much as he lets on he has; he might scare them out of
here yet.</p>
<p>So, thinks I, I'll go and search them rooms. &nbsp;Upstairs the
hall was dark, but I found the duke's room, and started to paw
around it with my hands; but I recollected it wouldn't be much like
the king to let anybody else take care of that money but his own
self; so then I went to his room and begun to paw around there.
&nbsp;But I see I couldn't do nothing without a candle, and I
dasn't light one, of course. &nbsp;So I judged I'd got to do the
other thing&mdash;lay for them and eavesdrop. &nbsp;About that time
I hears their footsteps coming, and was going to skip under the
bed; I reached for it, but it wasn't where I thought it would be;
but I touched the curtain that hid Mary Jane's frocks, so I jumped
in behind that and snuggled in amongst the gowns, and stood there
perfectly still.</p>

width="636" /><br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<p>They come in and shut the door; and the first thing the duke
done was to get down and look under the bed. &nbsp;Then I was glad
I hadn't found the bed when I wanted it. &nbsp;And yet, you know,
it's kind of natural to hide under the bed when you are up to
anything private. &nbsp;They sets down then, and the king says:</p>
<p>"Well, what is it? &nbsp;And cut it middlin' short, because it's
better for us to be down there a-whoopin' up the mournin' than up
here givin' 'em a chance to talk us over."</p>
<p>"Well, this is it, Capet. &nbsp;I ain't easy; I ain't
comfortable. &nbsp;That doctor lays on my mind. &nbsp;I wanted to
know your plans. &nbsp;I've got a notion, and I think it's a sound
one."</p>
<p>"What is it, duke?"</p>
<p>"That we better glide out of this before three in the morning,
and clip it down the river with what we've got. &nbsp;Specially,
seeing we got it so easy&mdash;GIVEN back to us, flung at our
heads, as you may say, when of course we allowed to have to steal
it back. &nbsp;I'm for knocking off and lighting out."</p>
<p>That made me feel pretty bad. &nbsp;About an hour or two ago it
would a been a little different, but now it made me feel bad and
disappointed, The king rips out and says:</p>
<p>"What! &nbsp;And not sell out the rest o' the property?
&nbsp;March off like a passel of fools and leave eight or nine
thous'n' dollars' worth o' property layin' around jest sufferin' to
be scooped in?&mdash;and all good, salable stuff, too."</p>
<p>The duke he grumbled; said the bag of gold was enough, and he
didn't want to go no deeper&mdash;didn't want to rob a lot of
orphans of EVERYTHING they had.</p>
<p>"Why, how you talk!" says the king. &nbsp;"We sha'n't rob 'em of
nothing at all but jest this money. &nbsp;The people that BUYS the
property is the suff'rers; because as soon 's it's found out 'at we
didn't own it&mdash;which won't be long after we've slid&mdash;the
sale won't be valid, and it 'll all go back to the estate.
&nbsp;These yer orphans 'll git their house back agin, and that's
enough for THEM; they're young and spry, and k'n easy earn a
livin'. &nbsp;THEY ain't a-goin to suffer. &nbsp;Why, jest
think&mdash;there's thous'n's and thous'n's that ain't nigh so well
off. &nbsp;Bless you, THEY ain't got noth'n' to complain of."</p>
<p>Well, the king he talked him blind; so at last he give in, and
said all right, but said he believed it was blamed foolishness to
stay, and that doctor hanging over them. &nbsp;But the king
says:</p>
<p>"Cuss the doctor! &nbsp;What do we k'yer for HIM? &nbsp;Hain't
we got all the fools in town on our side? &nbsp;And ain't that a
big enough majority in any town?"</p>
<p>So they got ready to go down stairs again. &nbsp;The duke
says:</p>
<p>"I don't think we put that money in a good place."</p>
<p>That cheered me up. &nbsp;I'd begun to think I warn't going to
get a hint of no kind to help me. &nbsp;The king says:</p>
<p>"Why?"</p>
<p>"Because Mary Jane 'll be in mourning from this out; and first
you know the nigger that does up the rooms will get an order to box
these duds up and put 'em away; and do you reckon a nigger can run
across money and not borrow some of it?"</p>
<p>"Your head's level agin, duke," says the king; and he comes
a-fumbling under the curtain two or three foot from where I was.
&nbsp;I stuck tight to the wall and kept mighty still, though
quivery; and I wondered what them fellows would say to me if they
catched me; and I tried to think what I'd better do if they did
catch me. &nbsp;But the king he got the bag before I could think
more than about a half a thought, and he never suspicioned I was
around. &nbsp;They took and shoved the bag through a rip in the
straw tick that was under the feather-bed, and crammed it in a foot
or two amongst the straw and said it was all right now, because a
nigger only makes up the feather-bed, and don't turn over the straw
tick only about twice a year, and so it warn't in no danger of
getting stole now.</p>

<p>But I knowed better. &nbsp;I had it out of there before they was
half-way down stairs. &nbsp;I groped along up to my cubby, and hid
it there till I could get a chance to do better. &nbsp;I judged I
better hide it outside of the house somewheres, because if they
missed it they would give the house a good ransacking: &nbsp;I
knowed that very well. &nbsp;Then I turned in, with my clothes all
on; but I couldn't a gone to sleep if I'd a wanted to, I was in
such a sweat to get through with the business. &nbsp;By and by I
heard the king and the duke come up; so I rolled off my pallet and
laid with my chin at the top of my ladder, and waited to see if
anything was going to happen. &nbsp;But nothing did.</p>
<p>So I held on till all the late sounds had quit and the early
ones hadn't begun yet; and then I slipped down the ladder.</p>

CHAPTER XXVII.</p>
<p>I CREPT to their doors and listened; they was snoring. &nbsp;So
I tiptoed along, and got down stairs all right. &nbsp;There warn't
a sound anywheres. &nbsp;I peeped through a crack of the
dining-room door, and see the men that was watching the corpse all
sound asleep on their chairs. &nbsp;The door was open into the
parlor, where the corpse was laying, and there was a candle in both
rooms. I passed along, and the parlor door was open; but I see
there warn't nobody in there but the remainders of Peter; so I
shoved on by; but the front door was locked, and the key wasn't
there. &nbsp;Just then I heard somebody coming down the stairs,
back behind me. &nbsp;I run in the parlor and took a swift look
around, and the only place I see to hide the bag was in the coffin.
&nbsp;The lid was shoved along about a foot, showing the dead man's
face down in there, with a wet cloth over it, and his shroud on.
&nbsp;I tucked the money-bag in under the lid, just down beyond
where his hands was crossed, which made me creep, they was so cold,
and then I run back across the room and in behind the door.</p>
<p>The person coming was Mary Jane. &nbsp;She went to the coffin,
very soft, and kneeled down and looked in; then she put up her
handkerchief, and I see she begun to cry, though I couldn't hear
her, and her back was to me. &nbsp;I slid out, and as I passed the
dining-room I thought I'd make sure them watchers hadn't seen me;
so I looked through the crack, and everything was all right.
&nbsp;They hadn't stirred.</p>
<p>I slipped up to bed, feeling ruther blue, on accounts of the
thing playing out that way after I had took so much trouble and run
so much resk about it. &nbsp;Says I, if it could stay where it is,
all right; because when we get down the river a hundred mile or two
I could write back to Mary Jane, and she could dig him up again and
get it; but that ain't the thing that's going to happen; the thing
that's going to happen is, the money 'll be found when they come to
screw on the lid. &nbsp;Then the king 'll get it again, and it 'll
be a long day before he gives anybody another chance to smouch it
from him. Of course I WANTED to slide down and get it out of there,
but I dasn't try it. &nbsp;Every minute it was getting earlier now,
and pretty soon some of them watchers would begin to stir, and I
might get catched&mdash;catched with six thousand dollars in my
hands that nobody hadn't hired me to take care of. &nbsp;I don't
wish to be mixed up in no such business as that, I says to
myself.</p>
<p>When I got down stairs in the morning the parlor was shut up,
and the watchers was gone. &nbsp;There warn't nobody around but the
family and the widow Bartley and our tribe. &nbsp;I watched their
faces to see if anything had been happening, but I couldn't
tell.</p>
<p>Towards the middle of the day the undertaker come with his man,
and they set the coffin in the middle of the room on a couple of
chairs, and then set all our chairs in rows, and borrowed more from
the neighbors till the hall and the parlor and the dining-room was
full. &nbsp;I see the coffin lid was the way it was before, but I
dasn't go to look in under it, with folks around.</p>
<p>Then the people begun to flock in, and the beats and the girls
took seats in the front row at the head of the coffin, and for a
half an hour the people filed around slow, in single rank, and
looked down at the dead man's face a minute, and some dropped in a
tear, and it was all very still and solemn, only the girls and the
beats holding handkerchiefs to their eyes and keeping their heads
bent, and sobbing a little. &nbsp;There warn't no other sound but
the scraping of the feet on the floor and blowing
noses&mdash;because people always blows them more at a funeral than
they do at other places except church.</p>
<p>When the place was packed full the undertaker he slid around in
his black gloves with his softy soothering ways, putting on the
last touches, and getting people and things all ship-shape and
comfortable, and making no more sound than a cat. &nbsp;He never
spoke; he moved people around, he squeezed in late ones, he opened
up passageways, and done it with nods, and signs with his hands.
&nbsp;Then he took his place over against the wall. He was the
softest, glidingest, stealthiest man I ever see; and there warn't
no more smile to him than there is to a ham.</p>

<br />
<p>They had borrowed a melodeum&mdash;a sick one; and when
everything was ready a young woman set down and worked it, and it
was pretty skreeky and colicky, and everybody joined in and sung,
and Peter was the only one that had a good thing, according to my
notion. &nbsp;Then the Reverend Hobson opened up, slow and solemn,
and begun to talk; and straight off the most outrageous row busted
out in the cellar a body ever heard; it was only one dog, but he
made a most powerful racket, and he kept it up right along; the
parson he had to stand there, over the coffin, and wait&mdash;you
couldn't hear yourself think. &nbsp;It was right down awkward, and
nobody didn't seem to know what to do. &nbsp;But pretty soon they
see that long-legged undertaker make a sign to the preacher as much
as to say, "Don't you worry&mdash;just depend on me." &nbsp;Then he
stooped down and begun to glide along the wall, just his shoulders
showing over the people's heads. &nbsp;So he glided along, and the
powwow and racket getting more and more outrageous all the time;
and at last, when he had gone around two sides of the room, he
disappears down cellar. &nbsp;Then in about two seconds we heard a
whack, and the dog he finished up with a most amazing howl or two,
and then everything was dead still, and the parson begun his solemn
talk where he left off. &nbsp;In a minute or two here comes this
undertaker's back and shoulders gliding along the wall again; and
so he glided and glided around three sides of the room, and then
rose up, and shaded his mouth with his hands, and stretched his
neck out towards the preacher, over the people's heads, and says,
in a kind of a coarse whisper, "HE HAD A RAT!" &nbsp;Then he
drooped down and glided along the wall again to his place.
&nbsp;You could see it was a great satisfaction to the people,
because naturally they wanted to know. &nbsp;A little thing like
that don't cost nothing, and it's just the little things that makes
a man to be looked up to and liked. &nbsp;There warn't no more
popular man in town than what that undertaker was.</p>

<br />
<p>Well, the funeral sermon was very good, but pison long and
tiresome; and then the king he shoved in and got off some of his
usual rubbage, and at last the job was through, and the undertaker
begun to sneak up on the coffin with his screw-driver. &nbsp;I was
in a sweat then, and watched him pretty keen. But he never meddled
at all; just slid the lid along as soft as mush, and screwed it
down tight and fast. &nbsp;So there I was! &nbsp;I didn't know
whether the money was in there or not. &nbsp;So, says I, s'pose
somebody has hogged that bag on the sly?&mdash;now how do I know
whether to write to Mary Jane or not? S'pose she dug him up and
didn't find nothing, what would she think of me? Blame it, I says,
I might get hunted up and jailed; I'd better lay low and keep dark,
and not write at all; the thing's awful mixed now; trying to better
it, I've worsened it a hundred times, and I wish to goodness I'd
just let it alone, dad fetch the whole business!</p>
<p>They buried him, and we come back home, and I went to watching
faces again&mdash;I couldn't help it, and I couldn't rest easy.
&nbsp;But nothing come of it; the faces didn't tell me nothing.</p>
<p>The king he visited around in the evening, and sweetened
everybody up, and made himself ever so friendly; and he give out
the idea that his congregation over in England would be in a sweat
about him, so he must hurry and settle up the estate right away and
leave for home. &nbsp;He was very sorry he was so pushed, and so
was everybody; they wished he could stay longer, but they said they
could see it couldn't be done. &nbsp;And he said of course him and
William would take the girls home with them; and that pleased
everybody too, because then the girls would be well fixed and
amongst their own relations; and it pleased the girls,
too&mdash;tickled them so they clean forgot they ever had a trouble
in the world; and told him to sell out as quick as he wanted to,
they would be ready. &nbsp;Them poor things was that glad and happy
it made my heart ache to see them getting fooled and lied to so,
but I didn't see no safe way for me to chip in and change the
general tune.</p>
<p>Well, blamed if the king didn't bill the house and the niggers
and all the property for auction straight off&mdash;sale two days
after the funeral; but anybody could buy private beforehand if they
wanted to.</p>
<p>So the next day after the funeral, along about noon-time, the
girls' joy got the first jolt. &nbsp;A couple of nigger traders
come along, and the king sold them the niggers reasonable, for
three-day drafts as they called it, and away they went, the two
sons up the river to Memphis, and their mother down the river to
Orleans. &nbsp;I thought them poor girls and them niggers would
break their hearts for grief; they cried around each other, and
took on so it most made me down sick to see it. &nbsp;The girls
said they hadn't ever dreamed of seeing the family separated or
sold away from the town. &nbsp;I can't ever get it out of my
memory, the sight of them poor miserable girls and niggers hanging
around each other's necks and crying; and I reckon I couldn't a
stood it all, but would a had to bust out and tell on our gang if I
hadn't knowed the sale warn't no account and the niggers would be
back home in a week or two.</p>
<p>The thing made a big stir in the town, too, and a good many come
out flatfooted and said it was scandalous to separate the mother
and the children that way. &nbsp;It injured the frauds some; but
the old fool he bulled right along, spite of all the duke could say
or do, and I tell you the duke was powerful uneasy.</p>
<p>Next day was auction day. &nbsp;About broad day in the morning
the king and the duke come up in the garret and woke me up, and I
see by their look that there was trouble. &nbsp;The king says:</p>
<p>"Was you in my room night before last?"</p>
<p>"No, your majesty"&mdash;which was the way I always called him
when nobody but our gang warn't around.</p>

<p>"Was you in there yisterday er last night?"</p>
<p>"No, your majesty."</p>
<p>"Honor bright, now&mdash;no lies."</p>
<p>"Honor bright, your majesty, I'm telling you the truth. &nbsp;I
hain't been a-near your room since Miss Mary Jane took you and the
duke and showed it to you."</p>
<p>The duke says:</p>
<p>"Have you seen anybody else go in there?"</p>
<p>"No, your grace, not as I remember, I believe."</p>
<p>"Stop and think."</p>
<p>I studied awhile and see my chance; then I says:</p>
<p>"Well, I see the niggers go in there several times."</p>
<p>Both of them gave a little jump, and looked like they hadn't
ever expected it, and then like they HAD. &nbsp;Then the duke
says:</p>
<p>"What, all of them?"</p>
<p>"No&mdash;leastways, not all at once&mdash;that is, I don't
think I ever see them all come OUT at once but just one time."</p>
<p>"Hello! &nbsp;When was that?"</p>
<p>"It was the day we had the funeral. &nbsp;In the morning.
&nbsp;It warn't early, because I overslept. &nbsp;I was just
starting down the ladder, and I see them."</p>
<p>"Well, go on, GO on! &nbsp;What did they do? &nbsp;How'd they
act?"</p>
<p>"They didn't do nothing. &nbsp;And they didn't act anyway much,
as fur as I see. They tiptoed away; so I seen, easy enough, that
they'd shoved in there to do up your majesty's room, or something,
s'posing you was up; and found you WARN'T up, and so they was
hoping to slide out of the way of trouble without waking you up, if
they hadn't already waked you up."</p>
<p>"Great guns, THIS is a go!" says the king; and both of them
looked pretty sick and tolerable silly. &nbsp;They stood there
a-thinking and scratching their heads a minute, and the duke he
bust into a kind of a little raspy chuckle, and says:</p>
<p>"It does beat all how neat the niggers played their hand.
&nbsp;They let on to be SORRY they was going out of this region!
&nbsp;And I believed they WAS sorry, and so did you, and so did
everybody. &nbsp;Don't ever tell ME any more that a nigger ain't
got any histrionic talent. &nbsp;Why, the way they played that
thing it would fool ANYBODY. &nbsp;In my opinion, there's a fortune
in 'em. &nbsp;If I had capital and a theater, I wouldn't want a
better lay-out than that&mdash;and here we've gone and sold 'em for
a song. &nbsp;Yes, and ain't privileged to sing the song yet.
&nbsp;Say, where IS that song&mdash;that draft?"</p>
<p>"In the bank for to be collected. &nbsp;Where WOULD it be?"</p>
<p>"Well, THAT'S all right then, thank goodness."</p>
<p>Says I, kind of timid-like:</p>
<p>"Is something gone wrong?"</p>
<p>The king whirls on me and rips out:</p>
<p>"None o' your business! &nbsp;You keep your head shet, and mind
y'r own affairs&mdash;if you got any. &nbsp;Long as you're in this
town don't you forgit THAT&mdash;you hear?" &nbsp;Then he says to
the duke, "We got to jest swaller it and say noth'n': &nbsp;mum's
the word for US."</p>
<p>As they was starting down the ladder the duke he chuckles again,
and says:</p>
<p>"Quick sales AND small profits! &nbsp;It's a good
business&mdash;yes."</p>

<br />
<br />
<br />
<p>The king snarls around on him and says:</p>
<p>"I was trying to do for the best in sellin' 'em out so quick.
&nbsp;If the profits has turned out to be none, lackin' considable,
and none to carry, is it my fault any more'n it's yourn?"</p>
<p>"Well, THEY'D be in this house yet and we WOULDN'T if I could a
got my advice listened to."</p>
<p>The king sassed back as much as was safe for him, and then
swapped around and lit into ME again. &nbsp;He give me down the
banks for not coming and TELLING him I see the niggers come out of
his room acting that way&mdash;said any fool would a KNOWED
something was up. &nbsp;And then waltzed in and cussed HIMSELF
awhile, and said it all come of him not laying late and taking his
natural rest that morning, and he'd be blamed if he'd ever do it
again. &nbsp;So they went off a-jawing; and I felt dreadful glad
I'd worked it all off on to the niggers, and yet hadn't done the
niggers no harm by it.</p>

CHAPTER XXVIII.</p>
<p>BY and by it was getting-up time. &nbsp;So I come down the
ladder and started for down-stairs; but as I come to the girls'
room the door was open, and I see Mary Jane setting by her old hair
trunk, which was open and she'd been packing things in
it&mdash;getting ready to go to England. &nbsp;But she had stopped
now with a folded gown in her lap, and had her face in her hands,
crying. &nbsp;I felt awful bad to see it; of course anybody would.
&nbsp;I went in there and says:</p>
<p>"Miss Mary Jane, you can't a-bear to see people in trouble, and
I can't&mdash;most always. &nbsp;Tell me about it."</p>
<p>So she done it. &nbsp;And it was the niggers&mdash;I just
expected it. &nbsp;She said the beautiful trip to England was most
about spoiled for her; she didn't know HOW she was ever going to be
happy there, knowing the mother and the children warn't ever going
to see each other no more&mdash;and then busted out bitterer than
ever, and flung up her hands, and says:</p>
<p>"Oh, dear, dear, to think they ain't EVER going to see each
other any more!"</p>
<p>"But they WILL&mdash;and inside of two weeks&mdash;and I KNOW
it!" says I.</p>
<p>Laws, it was out before I could think! &nbsp;And before I could
budge she throws her arms around my neck and told me to say it
AGAIN, say it AGAIN, say it AGAIN!</p>
<p>I see I had spoke too sudden and said too much, and was in a
close place. I asked her to let me think a minute; and she set
there, very impatient and excited and handsome, but looking kind of
happy and eased-up, like a person that's had a tooth pulled out.
&nbsp;So I went to studying it out. &nbsp;I says to myself, I
reckon a body that ups and tells the truth when he is in a tight
place is taking considerable many resks, though I ain't had no
experience, and can't say for certain; but it looks so to me,
anyway; and yet here's a case where I'm blest if it don't look to
me like the truth is better and actuly SAFER than a lie. &nbsp;I
must lay it by in my mind, and think it over some time or other,
it's so kind of strange and unregular. I never see nothing like it.
&nbsp;Well, I says to myself at last, I'm a-going to chance it;
I'll up and tell the truth this time, though it does seem most like
setting down on a kag of powder and touching it off just to see
where you'll go to. Then I says:</p>
<p>"Miss Mary Jane, is there any place out of town a little ways
where you could go and stay three or four days?"</p>
<p>"Yes; Mr. Lothrop's. &nbsp;Why?"</p>
<p>"Never mind why yet. &nbsp;If I'll tell you how I know the
niggers will see each other again inside of two weeks&mdash;here in
this house&mdash;and PROVE how I know it&mdash;will you go to Mr.
Lothrop's and stay four days?"</p>
<p>"Four days!" she says; "I'll stay a year!"</p>
<p>"All right," I says, "I don't want nothing more out of YOU than
just your word&mdash;I druther have it than another man's
kiss-the-Bible." &nbsp;She smiled and reddened up very sweet, and I
says, "If you don't mind it, I'll shut the door&mdash;and bolt
it."</p>
<p>Then I come back and set down again, and says:</p>
<p>"Don't you holler. &nbsp;Just set still and take it like a man.
&nbsp;I got to tell the truth, and you want to brace up, Miss Mary,
because it's a bad kind, and going to be hard to take, but there
ain't no help for it. &nbsp;These uncles of yourn ain't no uncles
at all; they're a couple of frauds&mdash;regular dead-beats.
&nbsp;There, now we're over the worst of it, you can stand the rest
middling easy."</p>
<p>It jolted her up like everything, of course; but I was over the
shoal water now, so I went right along, her eyes a-blazing higher
and higher all the time, and told her every blame thing, from where
we first struck that young fool going up to the steamboat, clear
through to where she flung herself on to the king's breast at the
front door and he kissed her sixteen or seventeen times&mdash;and
then up she jumps, with her face afire like sunset, and says:</p>
<p>"The brute! &nbsp;Come, don't waste a minute&mdash;not a
SECOND&mdash;we'll have them tarred and feathered, and flung in the
river!"</p>

<br />
<br />
<br />
<p>Says I:</p>
<p>"Cert'nly. &nbsp;But do you mean BEFORE you go to Mr. Lothrop's,
or&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Oh," she says, "what am I THINKING about!" she says, and set
right down again. &nbsp;"Don't mind what I said&mdash;please
don't&mdash;you WON'T, now, WILL you?" Laying her silky hand on
mine in that kind of a way that I said I would die first. &nbsp;"I
never thought, I was so stirred up," she says; "now go on, and I
won't do so any more. &nbsp;You tell me what to do, and whatever
you say I'll do it."</p>
<p>"Well," I says, "it's a rough gang, them two frauds, and I'm
fixed so I got to travel with them a while longer, whether I want
to or not&mdash;I druther not tell you why; and if you was to blow
on them this town would get me out of their claws, and I'd be all
right; but there'd be another person that you don't know about
who'd be in big trouble. &nbsp;Well, we got to save HIM, hain't we?
&nbsp;Of course. &nbsp;Well, then, we won't blow on them."</p>
<p>Saying them words put a good idea in my head. &nbsp;I see how
maybe I could get me and Jim rid of the frauds; get them jailed
here, and then leave. But I didn't want to run the raft in the
daytime without anybody aboard to answer questions but me; so I
didn't want the plan to begin working till pretty late to-night.
&nbsp;I says:</p>
<p>"Miss Mary Jane, I'll tell you what we'll do, and you won't have
to stay at Mr. Lothrop's so long, nuther. &nbsp;How fur is it?"</p>
<p>"A little short of four miles&mdash;right out in the country,
back here."</p>
<p>"Well, that 'll answer. &nbsp;Now you go along out there, and
lay low till nine or half-past to-night, and then get them to fetch
you home again&mdash;tell them you've thought of something.
&nbsp;If you get here before eleven put a candle in this window,
and if I don't turn up wait TILL eleven, and THEN if I don't turn
up it means I'm gone, and out of the way, and safe. Then you come
out and spread the news around, and get these beats jailed."</p>
<p>"Good," she says, "I'll do it."</p>
<p>"And if it just happens so that I don't get away, but get took
up along with them, you must up and say I told you the whole thing
beforehand, and you must stand by me all you can."</p>
<p>"Stand by you! indeed I will. &nbsp;They sha'n't touch a hair of
your head!" she says, and I see her nostrils spread and her eyes
snap when she said it, too.</p>
<p>"If I get away I sha'n't be here," I says, "to prove these
rapscallions ain't your uncles, and I couldn't do it if I WAS here.
&nbsp;I could swear they was beats and bummers, that's all, though
that's worth something. Well, there's others can do that better
than what I can, and they're people that ain't going to be doubted
as quick as I'd be. &nbsp;I'll tell you how to find them.
&nbsp;Gimme a pencil and a piece of paper. &nbsp;There&mdash;'Royal
Nonesuch, Bricksville.' &nbsp;Put it away, and don't lose it.
&nbsp;When the court wants to find out something about these two,
let them send up to Bricksville and say they've got the men that
played the Royal Nonesuch, and ask for some witnesses&mdash;why,
you'll have that entire town down here before you can hardly wink,
Miss Mary. &nbsp;And they'll come a-biling, too."</p>

<p>I judged we had got everything fixed about right now. &nbsp;So I
says:</p>
<p>"Just let the auction go right along, and don't worry.
&nbsp;Nobody don't have to pay for the things they buy till a whole
day after the auction on accounts of the short notice, and they
ain't going out of this till they get that money; and the way we've
fixed it the sale ain't going to count, and they ain't going to get
no money. &nbsp;It's just like the way it was with the
niggers&mdash;it warn't no sale, and the niggers will be back
before long. &nbsp;Why, they can't collect the money for the
NIGGERS yet&mdash;they're in the worst kind of a fix, Miss
Mary."</p>
<p>"Well," she says, "I'll run down to breakfast now, and then I'll
start straight for Mr. Lothrop's."</p>
<p>"'Deed, THAT ain't the ticket, Miss Mary Jane," I says, "by no
manner of means; go BEFORE breakfast."</p>
<p>"Why?"</p>
<p>"What did you reckon I wanted you to go at all for, Miss
Mary?"</p>
<p>"Well, I never thought&mdash;and come to think, I don't know.
&nbsp;What was it?"</p>
<p>"Why, it's because you ain't one of these leather-face people.
&nbsp;I don't want no better book than what your face is. &nbsp;A
body can set down and read it off like coarse print. &nbsp;Do you
reckon you can go and face your uncles when they come to kiss you
good-morning, and never&mdash;"</p>
<p>"There, there, don't! &nbsp;Yes, I'll go before
breakfast&mdash;I'll be glad to. And leave my sisters with
them?"</p>
<p>"Yes; never mind about them. &nbsp;They've got to stand it yet a
while. &nbsp;They might suspicion something if all of you was to
go. &nbsp;I don't want you to see them, nor your sisters, nor
nobody in this town; if a neighbor was to ask how is your uncles
this morning your face would tell something. &nbsp;No, you go right
along, Miss Mary Jane, and I'll fix it with all of them. I'll tell
Miss Susan to give your love to your uncles and say you've went
away for a few hours for to get a little rest and change, or to see
a friend, and you'll be back to-night or early in the morning."</p>
<p>"Gone to see a friend is all right, but I won't have my love
given to them."</p>
<p>"Well, then, it sha'n't be." &nbsp;It was well enough to tell
HER so&mdash;no harm in it. &nbsp;It was only a little thing to do,
and no trouble; and it's the little things that smooths people's
roads the most, down here below; it would make Mary Jane
comfortable, and it wouldn't cost nothing. &nbsp;Then I says:
&nbsp;"There's one more thing&mdash;that bag of money."</p>
<p>"Well, they've got that; and it makes me feel pretty silly to
think HOW they got it."</p>
<p>"No, you're out, there. &nbsp;They hain't got it."</p>
<p>"Why, who's got it?"</p>
<p>"I wish I knowed, but I don't. &nbsp;I HAD it, because I stole
it from them; and I stole it to give to you; and I know where I hid
it, but I'm afraid it ain't there no more. &nbsp;I'm awful sorry,
Miss Mary Jane, I'm just as sorry as I can be; but I done the best
I could; I did honest. &nbsp;I come nigh getting caught, and I had
to shove it into the first place I come to, and run&mdash;and it
warn't a good place."</p>
<p>"Oh, stop blaming yourself&mdash;it's too bad to do it, and I
won't allow it&mdash;you couldn't help it; it wasn't your fault.
&nbsp;Where did you hide it?"</p>
<p>I didn't want to set her to thinking about her troubles again;
and I couldn't seem to get my mouth to tell her what would make her
see that corpse laying in the coffin with that bag of money on his
stomach. &nbsp;So for a minute I didn't say nothing; then I
says:</p>
<p>"I'd ruther not TELL you where I put it, Miss Mary Jane, if you
don't mind letting me off; but I'll write it for you on a piece of
paper, and you can read it along the road to Mr. Lothrop's, if you
want to. &nbsp;Do you reckon that 'll do?"</p>
<p>"Oh, yes."</p>
<p>So I wrote: &nbsp;"I put it in the coffin. &nbsp;It was in there
when you was crying there, away in the night. &nbsp;I was behind
the door, and I was mighty sorry for you, Miss Mary Jane."</p>

<br />
<br />
<br />
<p>It made my eyes water a little to remember her crying there all
by herself in the night, and them devils laying there right under
her own roof, shaming her and robbing her; and when I folded it up
and give it to her I see the water come into her eyes, too; and she
shook me by the hand, hard, and says:</p>
<p>"GOOD-bye. &nbsp;I'm going to do everything just as you've told
me; and if I don't ever see you again, I sha'n't ever forget you
and I'll think of you a many and a many a time, and I'll PRAY for
you, too!"&mdash;and she was gone.</p>
<p>Pray for me! &nbsp;I reckoned if she knowed me she'd take a job
that was more nearer her size. &nbsp;But I bet she done it, just
the same&mdash;she was just that kind. &nbsp;She had the grit to
pray for Judus if she took the notion&mdash;there warn't no
back-down to her, I judge. &nbsp;You may say what you want to, but
in my opinion she had more sand in her than any girl I ever see; in
my opinion she was just full of sand. &nbsp;It sounds like
flattery, but it ain't no flattery. &nbsp;And when it comes to
beauty&mdash;and goodness, too&mdash;she lays over them all.
&nbsp;I hain't ever seen her since that time that I see her go out
of that door; no, I hain't ever seen her since, but I reckon I've
thought of her a many and a many a million times, and of her saying
she would pray for me; and if ever I'd a thought it would do any
good for me to pray for HER, blamed if I wouldn't a done it or
bust.</p>
<p>Well, Mary Jane she lit out the back way, I reckon; because
nobody see her go. &nbsp;When I struck Susan and the hare-lip, I
says:</p>
<p>"What's the name of them people over on t'other side of the
river that you all goes to see sometimes?"</p>
<p>They says:</p>
<p>"There's several; but it's the Proctors, mainly."</p>
<p>"That's the name," I says; "I most forgot it. &nbsp;Well, Miss
Mary Jane she told me to tell you she's gone over there in a
dreadful hurry&mdash;one of them's sick."</p>
<p>"Which one?"</p>
<p>"I don't know; leastways, I kinder forget; but I thinks
it's&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Sakes alive, I hope it ain't HANNER?"</p>
<p>"I'm sorry to say it," I says, "but Hanner's the very one."</p>
<p>"My goodness, and she so well only last week! &nbsp;Is she took
bad?"</p>
<p>"It ain't no name for it. &nbsp;They set up with her all night,
Miss Mary Jane said, and they don't think she'll last many
hours."</p>
<p>"Only think of that, now! &nbsp;What's the matter with her?"</p>
<p>I couldn't think of anything reasonable, right off that way, so
I says:</p>
<p>"Mumps."</p>
<p>"Mumps your granny! &nbsp;They don't set up with people that's
got the mumps."</p>
<p>"They don't, don't they? &nbsp;You better bet they do with THESE
mumps. &nbsp;These mumps is different. &nbsp;It's a new kind, Miss
Mary Jane said."</p>

width="318" /><br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<p>"How's it a new kind?"</p>
<p>"Because it's mixed up with other things."</p>
<p>"What other things?"</p>
<p>"Well, measles, and whooping-cough, and erysiplas, and
consumption, and yaller janders, and brain-fever, and I don't know
what all."</p>
<p>"My land! &nbsp;And they call it the MUMPS?"</p>
<p>"That's what Miss Mary Jane said."</p>
<p>"Well, what in the nation do they call it the MUMPS for?"</p>
<p>"Why, because it IS the mumps. &nbsp;That's what it starts
with."</p>
<p>"Well, ther' ain't no sense in it. &nbsp;A body might stump his
toe, and take pison, and fall down the well, and break his neck,
and bust his brains out, and somebody come along and ask what
killed him, and some numskull up and say, 'Why, he stumped his
TOE.' &nbsp;Would ther' be any sense in that? NO. &nbsp;And ther'
ain't no sense in THIS, nuther. &nbsp;Is it ketching?"</p>
<p>"Is it KETCHING? &nbsp;Why, how you talk. &nbsp;Is a HARROW
catching&mdash;in the dark? If you don't hitch on to one tooth,
you're bound to on another, ain't you? And you can't get away with
that tooth without fetching the whole harrow along, can you?
&nbsp;Well, these kind of mumps is a kind of a harrow, as you may
say&mdash;and it ain't no slouch of a harrow, nuther, you come to
get it hitched on good."</p>
<p>"Well, it's awful, I think," says the hare-lip. &nbsp;"I'll go
to Uncle Harvey and&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Oh, yes," I says, "I WOULD. &nbsp;Of COURSE I would. &nbsp;I
wouldn't lose no time."</p>
<p>"Well, why wouldn't you?"</p>
<p>"Just look at it a minute, and maybe you can see. &nbsp;Hain't
your uncles obleegd to get along home to England as fast as they
can? &nbsp;And do you reckon they'd be mean enough to go off and
leave you to go all that journey by yourselves? &nbsp;YOU know
they'll wait for you. &nbsp;So fur, so good. Your uncle Harvey's a
preacher, ain't he? &nbsp;Very well, then; is a PREACHER going to
deceive a steamboat clerk? is he going to deceive a SHIP
CLERK?&mdash;so as to get them to let Miss Mary Jane go aboard?
&nbsp;Now YOU know he ain't. &nbsp;What WILL he do, then?
&nbsp;Why, he'll say, 'It's a great pity, but my church matters has
got to get along the best way they can; for my niece has been
exposed to the dreadful pluribus-unum mumps, and so it's my bounden
duty to set down here and wait the three months it takes to show on
her if she's got it.' &nbsp;But never mind, if you think it's best
to tell your uncle Harvey&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Shucks, and stay fooling around here when we could all be
having good times in England whilst we was waiting to find out
whether Mary Jane's got it or not? &nbsp;Why, you talk like a
muggins."</p>
<p>"Well, anyway, maybe you'd better tell some of the
neighbors."</p>
<p>"Listen at that, now. &nbsp;You do beat all for natural
stupidness. &nbsp;Can't you SEE that THEY'D go and tell?
&nbsp;Ther' ain't no way but just to not tell anybody at ALL."</p>
<p>"Well, maybe you're right&mdash;yes, I judge you ARE right."</p>
<p>"But I reckon we ought to tell Uncle Harvey she's gone out a
while, anyway, so he won't be uneasy about her?"</p>
<p>"Yes, Miss Mary Jane she wanted you to do that. &nbsp;She says,
'Tell them to give Uncle Harvey and William my love and a kiss, and
say I've run over the river to see Mr.'&mdash;Mr.&mdash;what IS the
name of that rich family your uncle Peter used to think so much
of?&mdash;I mean the one that&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Why, you must mean the Apthorps, ain't it?"</p>
<p>"Of course; bother them kind of names, a body can't ever seem to
remember them, half the time, somehow. &nbsp;Yes, she said, say she
has run over for to ask the Apthorps to be sure and come to the
auction and buy this house, because she allowed her uncle Peter
would ruther they had it than anybody else; and she's going to
stick to them till they say they'll come, and then, if she ain't
too tired, she's coming home; and if she is, she'll be home in the
morning anyway. &nbsp;She said, don't say nothing about the
Proctors, but only about the Apthorps&mdash;which 'll be perfectly
true, because she is going there to speak about their buying the
house; I know it, because she told me so herself."</p>
<p>"All right," they said, and cleared out to lay for their uncles,
and give them the love and the kisses, and tell them the
message.</p>
<p>Everything was all right now. &nbsp;The girls wouldn't say
nothing because they wanted to go to England; and the king and the
duke would ruther Mary Jane was off working for the auction than
around in reach of Doctor Robinson. &nbsp;I felt very good; I
judged I had done it pretty neat&mdash;I reckoned Tom Sawyer
couldn't a done it no neater himself. &nbsp;Of course he would a
throwed more style into it, but I can't do that very handy, not
being brung up to it.</p>
<p>Well, they held the auction in the public square, along towards
the end of the afternoon, and it strung along, and strung along,
and the old man he was on hand and looking his level pisonest, up
there longside of the auctioneer, and chipping in a little
Scripture now and then, or a little goody-goody saying of some
kind, and the duke he was around goo-gooing for sympathy all he
knowed how, and just spreading himself generly.</p>

<p>But by and by the thing dragged through, and everything was
sold&mdash;everything but a little old trifling lot in the
graveyard. &nbsp;So they'd got to work that off&mdash;I never see
such a girafft as the king was for wanting to swallow EVERYTHING.
&nbsp;Well, whilst they was at it a steamboat landed, and in about
two minutes up comes a crowd a-whooping and yelling and laughing
and carrying on, and singing out:</p>
<p>"HERE'S your opposition line! here's your two sets o' heirs to
old Peter Wilks&mdash;and you pays your money and you takes your

CHAPTER XXIX.</p>
<p>THEY was fetching a very nice-looking old gentleman along, and a
nice-looking younger one, with his right arm in a sling. &nbsp;And,
my souls, how the people yelled and laughed, and kept it up.
&nbsp;But I didn't see no joke about it, and I judged it would
strain the duke and the king some to see any. &nbsp;I reckoned
they'd turn pale. &nbsp;But no, nary a pale did THEY turn. The duke
he never let on he suspicioned what was up, but just went a
goo-gooing around, happy and satisfied, like a jug that's googling
out buttermilk; and as for the king, he just gazed and gazed down
sorrowful on them new-comers like it give him the stomach-ache in
his very heart to think there could be such frauds and rascals in
the world. &nbsp;Oh, he done it admirable. &nbsp;Lots of the
principal people gethered around the king, to let him see they was
on his side. &nbsp;That old gentleman that had just come looked all
puzzled to death. &nbsp;Pretty soon he begun to speak, and I see
straight off he pronounced LIKE an Englishman&mdash;not the king's
way, though the king's WAS pretty good for an imitation. &nbsp;I
can't give the old gent's words, nor I can't imitate him; but he
turned around to the crowd, and says, about like this:</p>
<p>"This is a surprise to me which I wasn't looking for; and I'll
acknowledge, candid and frank, I ain't very well fixed to meet it
and answer it; for my brother and me has had misfortunes; he's
broke his arm, and our baggage got put off at a town above here
last night in the night by a mistake. &nbsp;I am Peter Wilks'
brother Harvey, and this is his brother William, which can't hear
nor speak&mdash;and can't even make signs to amount to much, now't
he's only got one hand to work them with. &nbsp;We are who we say
we are; and in a day or two, when I get the baggage, I can prove
it. But up till then I won't say nothing more, but go to the hotel
and wait."</p>
<p>So him and the new dummy started off; and the king he laughs,
and blethers out:</p>
<p>"Broke his arm&mdash;VERY likely, AIN'T it?&mdash;and very
convenient, too, for a fraud that's got to make signs, and ain't
learnt how. &nbsp;Lost their baggage! That's MIGHTY good!&mdash;and
mighty ingenious&mdash;under the CIRCUMSTANCES!"</p>
<p>So he laughed again; and so did everybody else, except three or
four, or maybe half a dozen. &nbsp;One of these was that doctor;
another one was a sharp-looking gentleman, with a carpet-bag of the
old-fashioned kind made out of carpet-stuff, that had just come off
of the steamboat and was talking to him in a low voice, and
glancing towards the king now and then and nodding their
heads&mdash;it was Levi Bell, the lawyer that was gone up to
Louisville; and another one was a big rough husky that come along
and listened to all the old gentleman said, and was listening to
the king now. And when the king got done this husky up and
says:</p>
<p>"Say, looky here; if you are Harvey Wilks, when'd you come to
this town?"</p>
<p>"The day before the funeral, friend," says the king.</p>
<p>"But what time o' day?"</p>
<p>"In the evenin'&mdash;'bout an hour er two before sundown."</p>
<p>"HOW'D you come?"</p>
<p>"I come down on the Susan Powell from Cincinnati."</p>
<p>"Well, then, how'd you come to be up at the Pint in the
MORNIN'&mdash;in a canoe?"</p>
<p>"I warn't up at the Pint in the mornin'."</p>
<p>"It's a lie."</p>
<p>Several of them jumped for him and begged him not to talk that
way to an old man and a preacher.</p>
<p>"Preacher be hanged, he's a fraud and a liar. &nbsp;He was up at
the Pint that mornin'. &nbsp;I live up there, don't I? &nbsp;Well,
I was up there, and he was up there. &nbsp;I see him there.
&nbsp;He come in a canoe, along with Tim Collins and a boy."</p>
<p>The doctor he up and says:</p>
<p>"Would you know the boy again if you was to see him, Hines?"</p>
<p>"I reckon I would, but I don't know. &nbsp;Why, yonder he is,
now. &nbsp;I know him perfectly easy."</p>
<p>It was me he pointed at. &nbsp;The doctor says:</p>
<p>"Neighbors, I don't know whether the new couple is frauds or
not; but if THESE two ain't frauds, I am an idiot, that's all.
&nbsp;I think it's our duty to see that they don't get away from
here till we've looked into this thing. Come along, Hines; come
along, the rest of you. &nbsp;We'll take these fellows to the
tavern and affront them with t'other couple, and I reckon we'll
find out SOMETHING before we get through."</p>
<p>It was nuts for the crowd, though maybe not for the king's
friends; so we all started. &nbsp;It was about sundown. &nbsp;The
doctor he led me along by the hand, and was plenty kind enough, but
he never let go my hand.</p>
<br />

width="433" /><br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<p>We all got in a big room in the hotel, and lit up some candles,
and fetched in the new couple. &nbsp;First, the doctor says:</p>
<p>"I don't wish to be too hard on these two men, but I think
they're frauds, and they may have complices that we don't know
nothing about. &nbsp;If they have, won't the complices get away
with that bag of gold Peter Wilks left? &nbsp;It ain't unlikely.
&nbsp;If these men ain't frauds, they won't object to sending for
that money and letting us keep it till they prove they're all
right&mdash;ain't that so?"</p>
<p>Everybody agreed to that. &nbsp;So I judged they had our gang in
a pretty tight place right at the outstart. &nbsp;But the king he
only looked sorrowful, and says:</p>
<p>"Gentlemen, I wish the money was there, for I ain't got no
disposition to throw anything in the way of a fair, open,
out-and-out investigation o' this misable business; but, alas, the
money ain't there; you k'n send and see, if you want to."</p>
<p>"Where is it, then?"</p>
<p>"Well, when my niece give it to me to keep for her I took and
hid it inside o' the straw tick o' my bed, not wishin' to bank it
for the few days we'd be here, and considerin' the bed a safe
place, we not bein' used to niggers, and suppos'n' 'em honest, like
servants in England. &nbsp;The niggers stole it the very next
mornin' after I had went down stairs; and when I sold 'em I hadn't
missed the money yit, so they got clean away with it. &nbsp;My
servant here k'n tell you 'bout it, gentlemen."</p>
<p>The doctor and several said "Shucks!" and I see nobody didn't
altogether believe him. &nbsp;One man asked me if I see the niggers
steal it. &nbsp;I said no, but I see them sneaking out of the room
and hustling away, and I never thought nothing, only I reckoned
they was afraid they had waked up my master and was trying to get
away before he made trouble with them. &nbsp;That was all they
asked me. &nbsp;Then the doctor whirls on me and says:</p>
<p>"Are YOU English, too?"</p>
<p>I says yes; and him and some others laughed, and said,
"Stuff!"</p>
<p>Well, then they sailed in on the general investigation, and
there we had it, up and down, hour in, hour out, and nobody never
said a word about supper, nor ever seemed to think about
it&mdash;and so they kept it up, and kept it up; and it WAS the
worst mixed-up thing you ever see. &nbsp;They made the king tell
his yarn, and they made the old gentleman tell his'n; and anybody
but a lot of prejudiced chuckleheads would a SEEN that the old
gentleman was spinning truth and t'other one lies. &nbsp;And by and
by they had me up to tell what I knowed. &nbsp;The king he give me
a left-handed look out of the corner of his eye, and so I knowed
enough to talk on the right side. &nbsp;I begun to tell about
Sheffield, and how we lived there, and all about the English
Wilkses, and so on; but I didn't get pretty fur till the doctor
begun to laugh; and Levi Bell, the lawyer, says:</p>
<p>"Set down, my boy; I wouldn't strain myself if I was you.
&nbsp;I reckon you ain't used to lying, it don't seem to come
handy; what you want is practice. &nbsp;You do it pretty
awkward."</p>
<p>I didn't care nothing for the compliment, but I was glad to be
let off, anyway.</p>
<p>The doctor he started to say something, and turns and says:</p>
<p>"If you'd been in town at first, Levi Bell&mdash;" The king
broke in and reached out his hand, and says:</p>
<p>"Why, is this my poor dead brother's old friend that he's wrote
so often about?"</p>
<p>The lawyer and him shook hands, and the lawyer smiled and looked
pleased, and they talked right along awhile, and then got to one
side and talked low; and at last the lawyer speaks up and says:</p>
<p>"That 'll fix it. &nbsp;I'll take the order and send it, along
with your brother's, and then they'll know it's all right."</p>
<p>So they got some paper and a pen, and the king he set down and
twisted his head to one side, and chawed his tongue, and scrawled
off something; and then they give the pen to the duke&mdash;and
then for the first time the duke looked sick. &nbsp;But he took the
pen and wrote. &nbsp;So then the lawyer turns to the new old
gentleman and says:</p>
<p>"You and your brother please write a line or two and sign your
names."</p>

width="445" /><br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<p>The old gentleman wrote, but nobody couldn't read it. &nbsp;The
lawyer looked powerful astonished, and says:</p>
<p>"Well, it beats ME"&mdash;and snaked a lot of old letters out of
his pocket, and examined them, and then examined the old man's
writing, and then THEM again; and then says: &nbsp;"These old
letters is from Harvey Wilks; and here's THESE two handwritings,
and anybody can see they didn't write them" (the king and the duke
looked sold and foolish, I tell you, to see how the lawyer had took
them in), "and here's THIS old gentleman's hand writing, and
anybody can tell, easy enough, HE didn't write them&mdash;fact is,
the scratches he makes ain't properly WRITING at all. &nbsp;Now,
here's some letters from&mdash;"</p>
<p>The new old gentleman says:</p>
<p>"If you please, let me explain. &nbsp;Nobody can read my hand
but my brother there&mdash;so he copies for me. &nbsp;It's HIS hand
you've got there, not mine."</p>
<p>"WELL!" says the lawyer, "this IS a state of things. &nbsp;I've
got some of William's letters, too; so if you'll get him to write a
line or so we can com&mdash;"</p>
<p>"He CAN'T write with his left hand," says the old gentleman.
&nbsp;"If he could use his right hand, you would see that he wrote
his own letters and mine too. &nbsp;Look at both,
please&mdash;they're by the same hand."</p>
<p>The lawyer done it, and says:</p>
<p>"I believe it's so&mdash;and if it ain't so, there's a heap
stronger resemblance than I'd noticed before, anyway. &nbsp;Well,
well, well! &nbsp;I thought we was right on the track of a
solution, but it's gone to grass, partly. &nbsp;But anyway, one
thing is proved&mdash;THESE two ain't either of 'em
Wilkses"&mdash;and he wagged his head towards the king and the
duke.</p>
<p>Well, what do you think? &nbsp;That muleheaded old fool wouldn't
give in THEN! Indeed he wouldn't. &nbsp;Said it warn't no fair
test. &nbsp;Said his brother William was the cussedest joker in the
world, and hadn't tried to write&mdash;HE see William was going to
play one of his jokes the minute he put the pen to paper. &nbsp;And
so he warmed up and went warbling and warbling right along till he
was actuly beginning to believe what he was saying HIMSELF; but
pretty soon the new gentleman broke in, and says:</p>
<p>"I've thought of something. &nbsp;Is there anybody here that
helped to lay out my br&mdash;helped to lay out the late Peter
Wilks for burying?"</p>
<p>"Yes," says somebody, "me and Ab Turner done it. &nbsp;We're
both here."</p>
<p>Then the old man turns towards the king, and says:</p>
<p>"Perhaps this gentleman can tell me what was tattooed on his
breast?"</p>
<p>Blamed if the king didn't have to brace up mighty quick, or he'd
a squshed down like a bluff bank that the river has cut under, it
took him so sudden; and, mind you, it was a thing that was
calculated to make most ANYBODY sqush to get fetched such a solid
one as that without any notice, because how was HE going to know
what was tattooed on the man? &nbsp;He whitened a little; he
couldn't help it; and it was mighty still in there, and everybody
bending a little forwards and gazing at him. &nbsp;Says I to
myself, NOW he'll throw up the sponge&mdash;there ain't no more
use. &nbsp;Well, did he? &nbsp;A body can't hardly believe it, but
he didn't. &nbsp;I reckon he thought he'd keep the thing up till he
tired them people out, so they'd thin out, and him and the duke
could break loose and get away. &nbsp;Anyway, he set there, and
pretty soon he begun to smile, and says:</p>
<p>"Mf! &nbsp;It's a VERY tough question, AIN'T it! &nbsp;YES, sir,
I k'n tell you what's tattooed on his breast. &nbsp;It's jest a
small, thin, blue arrow&mdash;that's what it is; and if you don't
look clost, you can't see it. &nbsp;NOW what do you
say&mdash;hey?"</p>
<p>Well, I never see anything like that old blister for clean
out-and-out cheek.</p>
<p>The new old gentleman turns brisk towards Ab Turner and his
pard, and his eye lights up like he judged he'd got the king THIS
time, and says:</p>
<p>"There&mdash;you've heard what he said! &nbsp;Was there any such
mark on Peter Wilks' breast?"</p>
<p>Both of them spoke up and says:</p>
<p>"We didn't see no such mark."</p>
<p>"Good!" says the old gentleman. &nbsp;"Now, what you DID see on
his breast was a small dim P, and a B (which is an initial he
dropped when he was young), and a W, with dashes between them, so:
&nbsp;P&mdash;B&mdash;W"&mdash;and he marked them that way on a
piece of paper. &nbsp;"Come, ain't that what you saw?"</p>
<p>Both of them spoke up again, and says:</p>
<p>"No, we DIDN'T. &nbsp;We never seen any marks at all."</p>
<p>Well, everybody WAS in a state of mind now, and they sings
out:</p>
<p>"The whole BILIN' of 'm 's frauds! &nbsp;Le's duck 'em! le's
drown 'em! le's ride 'em on a rail!" and everybody was whooping at
once, and there was a rattling powwow. &nbsp;But the lawyer he
jumps on the table and yells, and says:</p>
<p>"Gentlemen&mdash;gentleMEN! &nbsp;Hear me just a word&mdash;just
a SINGLE word&mdash;if you PLEASE! &nbsp;There's one way
yet&mdash;let's go and dig up the corpse and look."</p>

width="405" /><br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<p>That took them.</p>
<p>"Hooray!" they all shouted, and was starting right off; but the
lawyer and the doctor sung out:</p>
<p>"Hold on, hold on! &nbsp;Collar all these four men and the boy,
and fetch THEM along, too!"</p>
<p>"We'll do it!" they all shouted; "and if we don't find them
marks we'll lynch the whole gang!"</p>
<p>I WAS scared, now, I tell you. &nbsp;But there warn't no getting
away, you know. They gripped us all, and marched us right along,
straight for the graveyard, which was a mile and a half down the
river, and the whole town at our heels, for we made noise enough,
and it was only nine in the evening.</p>
<p>As we went by our house I wished I hadn't sent Mary Jane out of
town; because now if I could tip her the wink she'd light out and
save me, and blow on our dead-beats.</p>
<p>Well, we swarmed along down the river road, just carrying on
like wildcats; and to make it more scary the sky was darking up,
and the lightning beginning to wink and flitter, and the wind to
shiver amongst the leaves. This was the most awful trouble and most
dangersome I ever was in; and I was kinder stunned; everything was
going so different from what I had allowed for; stead of being
fixed so I could take my own time if I wanted to, and see all the
fun, and have Mary Jane at my back to save me and set me free when
the close-fit come, here was nothing in the world betwixt me and
sudden death but just them tattoo-marks. &nbsp;If they didn't find
them&mdash;</p>
<p>I couldn't bear to think about it; and yet, somehow, I couldn't
think about nothing else. &nbsp;It got darker and darker, and it
was a beautiful time to give the crowd the slip; but that big husky
had me by the wrist&mdash;Hines&mdash;and a body might as well try
to give Goliar the slip. &nbsp;He dragged me right along, he was so
excited, and I had to run to keep up.</p>
<p>When they got there they swarmed into the graveyard and washed
over it like an overflow. &nbsp;And when they got to the grave they
found they had about a hundred times as many shovels as they
wanted, but nobody hadn't thought to fetch a lantern. &nbsp;But
they sailed into digging anyway by the flicker of the lightning,
and sent a man to the nearest house, a half a mile off, to borrow
one.</p>
<p>So they dug and dug like everything; and it got awful dark, and
the rain started, and the wind swished and swushed along, and the
lightning come brisker and brisker, and the thunder boomed; but
them people never took no notice of it, they was so full of this
business; and one minute you could see everything and every face in
that big crowd, and the shovelfuls of dirt sailing up out of the
grave, and the next second the dark wiped it all out, and you
couldn't see nothing at all.</p>
<p>At last they got out the coffin and begun to unscrew the lid,
and then such another crowding and shouldering and shoving as there
was, to scrouge in and get a sight, you never see; and in the dark,
that way, it was awful. &nbsp;Hines he hurt my wrist dreadful
pulling and tugging so, and I reckon he clean forgot I was in the
world, he was so excited and panting.</p>
<p>All of a sudden the lightning let go a perfect sluice of white
glare, and somebody sings out:</p>
<p>"By the living jingo, here's the bag of gold on his breast!"</p>
<p>Hines let out a whoop, like everybody else, and dropped my wrist
and give a big surge to bust his way in and get a look, and the way
I lit out and shinned for the road in the dark there ain't nobody
can tell.</p>
<p>I had the road all to myself, and I fairly flew&mdash;leastways,
I had it all to myself except the solid dark, and the now-and-then
glares, and the buzzing of the rain, and the thrashing of the wind,
and the splitting of the thunder; and sure as you are born I did
clip it along!</p>
<p>When I struck the town I see there warn't nobody out in the
storm, so I never hunted for no back streets, but humped it
straight through the main one; and when I begun to get towards our
house I aimed my eye and set it. No light there; the house all
dark&mdash;which made me feel sorry and disappointed, I didn't know
why. &nbsp;But at last, just as I was sailing by, FLASH comes the
light in Mary Jane's window! and my heart swelled up sudden, like
to bust; and the same second the house and all was behind me in the
dark, and wasn't ever going to be before me no more in this world.
She WAS the best girl I ever see, and had the most sand.</p>
<p>The minute I was far enough above the town to see I could make
the towhead, I begun to look sharp for a boat to borrow, and the
first time the lightning showed me one that wasn't chained I
snatched it and shoved. It was a canoe, and warn't fastened with
nothing but a rope. &nbsp;The towhead was a rattling big distance
off, away out there in the middle of the river, but I didn't lose
no time; and when I struck the raft at last I was so fagged I would
a just laid down to blow and gasp if I could afforded it. &nbsp;But
I didn't. &nbsp;As I sprung aboard I sung out:</p>
<p>"Out with you, Jim, and set her loose! &nbsp;Glory be to
goodness, we're shut of them!"</p>
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<a name="c29-260" id="c29-260"></a><br />

<img alt="c29-260.jpg (73K)" src="images/c29-260.jpg" height="576"
width="456" /><br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<p>Jim lit out, and was a-coming for me with both arms spread, he
was so full of joy; but when I glimpsed him in the lightning my
heart shot up in my mouth and I went overboard backwards; for I
forgot he was old King Lear and a drownded A-rab all in one, and it
most scared the livers and lights out of me. &nbsp;But Jim fished
me out, and was going to hug me and bless me, and so on, he was so
glad I was back and we was shut of the king and the duke, but I
says:</p>
<p>"Not now; have it for breakfast, have it for breakfast!
&nbsp;Cut loose and let her slide!"</p>
<p>So in two seconds away we went a-sliding down the river, and it
DID seem so good to be free again and all by ourselves on the big
river, and nobody to bother us. &nbsp;I had to skip around a bit,
and jump up and crack my heels a few times&mdash;I couldn't help
it; but about the third crack I noticed a sound that I knowed
mighty well, and held my breath and listened and waited; and sure
enough, when the next flash busted out over the water, here they
come!&mdash;and just a-laying to their oars and making their skiff
hum! &nbsp;It was the king and the duke.</p>
<p>So I wilted right down on to the planks then, and give up; and
it was all I could do to keep from crying.</p>

CHAPTER XXX.</p>
<p>WHEN they got aboard the king went for me, and shook me by the
collar, and says:</p>
<p>"Tryin' to give us the slip, was ye, you pup! &nbsp;Tired of our
company, hey?"</p>
<p>I says:</p>
<p>"No, your majesty, we warn't&mdash;PLEASE don't, your
majesty!"</p>
<p>"Quick, then, and tell us what WAS your idea, or I'll shake the
insides out o' you!"</p>
<p>"Honest, I'll tell you everything just as it happened, your
majesty. &nbsp;The man that had a-holt of me was very good to me,
and kept saying he had a boy about as big as me that died last
year, and he was sorry to see a boy in such a dangerous fix; and
when they was all took by surprise by finding the gold, and made a
rush for the coffin, he lets go of me and whispers, 'Heel it now,
or they'll hang ye, sure!' and I lit out. &nbsp;It didn't seem no
good for ME to stay&mdash;I couldn't do nothing, and I didn't want
to be hung if I could get away. &nbsp;So I never stopped running
till I found the canoe; and when I got here I told Jim to hurry, or
they'd catch me and hang me yet, and said I was afeard you and the
duke wasn't alive now, and I was awful sorry, and so was Jim, and
was awful glad when we see you coming; you may ask Jim if I
didn't."</p>
<p>Jim said it was so; and the king told him to shut up, and said,
"Oh, yes, it's MIGHTY likely!" and shook me up again, and said he
reckoned he'd drownd me. &nbsp;But the duke says:</p>
<p>"Leggo the boy, you old idiot! &nbsp;Would YOU a done any
different? &nbsp;Did you inquire around for HIM when you got loose?
&nbsp;I don't remember it."</p>
<p>So the king let go of me, and begun to cuss that town and
everybody in it. But the duke says:</p>
<p>"You better a blame' sight give YOURSELF a good cussing, for
you're the one that's entitled to it most. &nbsp;You hain't done a
thing from the start that had any sense in it, except coming out so
cool and cheeky with that imaginary blue-arrow mark. &nbsp;That WAS
bright&mdash;it was right down bully; and it was the thing that
saved us. &nbsp;For if it hadn't been for that they'd a jailed us
till them Englishmen's baggage come&mdash;and then&mdash;the
penitentiary, you bet! But that trick took 'em to the graveyard,
and the gold done us a still bigger kindness; for if the excited
fools hadn't let go all holts and made that rush to get a look we'd
a slept in our cravats to-night&mdash;cravats warranted to WEAR,
too&mdash;longer than WE'D need 'em."</p>
<p>They was still a minute&mdash;thinking; then the king says, kind
of absent-minded like:</p>
<p>"Mf! &nbsp;And we reckoned the NIGGERS stole it!"</p>
<p>That made me squirm!</p>
<p>"Yes," says the duke, kinder slow and deliberate and sarcastic,
"WE did."</p>
<p>After about a half a minute the king drawls out:</p>
<p>"Leastways, I did."</p>
<p>The duke says, the same way:</p>
<p>"On the contrary, I did."</p>
<p>The king kind of ruffles up, and says:</p>
<p>"Looky here, Bilgewater, what'r you referrin' to?"</p>
<p>The duke says, pretty brisk:</p>
<p>"When it comes to that, maybe you'll let me ask, what was YOU
referring to?"</p>
<p>"Shucks!" says the king, very sarcastic; "but I don't
know&mdash;maybe you was asleep, and didn't know what you was
about."</p>
<p>The duke bristles up now, and says:</p>
<p>"Oh, let UP on this cussed nonsense; do you take me for a blame'
fool? Don't you reckon I know who hid that money in that
coffin?"</p>
<p>"YES, sir! &nbsp;I know you DO know, because you done it
yourself!"</p>
<p>"It's a lie!"&mdash;and the duke went for him. &nbsp;The king
sings out:</p>
<p>"Take y'r hands off!&mdash;leggo my throat!&mdash;I take it all
back!"</p>
<br />

<img alt="c30-263.jpg (54K)" src="images/c30-263.jpg" height="404"
width="657" /><br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<p>The duke says:</p>
<p>"Well, you just own up, first, that you DID hide that money
there, intending to give me the slip one of these days, and come
back and dig it up, and have it all to yourself."</p>
<p>"Wait jest a minute, duke&mdash;answer me this one question,
honest and fair; if you didn't put the money there, say it, and
I'll b'lieve you, and take back everything I said."</p>
<p>"You old scoundrel, I didn't, and you know I didn't.
&nbsp;There, now!"</p>
<p>"Well, then, I b'lieve you. &nbsp;But answer me only jest this
one more&mdash;now DON'T git mad; didn't you have it in your mind
to hook the money and hide it?"</p>
<p>The duke never said nothing for a little bit; then he says:</p>
<p>"Well, I don't care if I DID, I didn't DO it, anyway. &nbsp;But
you not only had it in mind to do it, but you DONE it."</p>
<p>"I wisht I never die if I done it, duke, and that's honest.
&nbsp;I won't say I warn't goin' to do it, because I WAS; but
you&mdash;I mean somebody&mdash;got in ahead o' me."</p>
<p>"It's a lie! &nbsp;You done it, and you got to SAY you done it,
or&mdash;"</p>
<p>The king began to gurgle, and then he gasps out:</p>
<p>"'Nough!&mdash;I OWN UP!"</p>
<p>I was very glad to hear him say that; it made me feel much more
easier than what I was feeling before. &nbsp;So the duke took his
hands off and says:</p>
<p>"If you ever deny it again I'll drown you. &nbsp;It's WELL for
you to set there and blubber like a baby&mdash;it's fitten for you,
after the way you've acted. I never see such an old ostrich for
wanting to gobble everything&mdash;and I a-trusting you all the
time, like you was my own father. &nbsp;You ought to been ashamed
of yourself to stand by and hear it saddled on to a lot of poor
niggers, and you never say a word for 'em. &nbsp;It makes me feel
ridiculous to think I was soft enough to BELIEVE that rubbage.
&nbsp;Cuss you, I can see now why you was so anxious to make up the
deffisit&mdash;you wanted to get what money I'd got out of the
Nonesuch and one thing or another, and scoop it ALL!"</p>
<p>The king says, timid, and still a-snuffling:</p>
<p>"Why, duke, it was you that said make up the deffisit; it warn't
me."</p>
<p>"Dry up! &nbsp;I don't want to hear no more out of you!" says
the duke. &nbsp;"And NOW you see what you GOT by it. &nbsp;They've
got all their own money back, and all of OURN but a shekel or two
BESIDES. &nbsp;G'long to bed, and don't you deffersit ME no more
deffersits, long 's YOU live!"</p>
<p>So the king sneaked into the wigwam and took to his bottle for
comfort, and before long the duke tackled HIS bottle; and so in
about a half an hour they was as thick as thieves again, and the
tighter they got the lovinger they got, and went off a-snoring in
each other's arms. &nbsp;They both got powerful mellow, but I
noticed the king didn't get mellow enough to forget to remember to
not deny about hiding the money-bag again. &nbsp;That made me feel
easy and satisfied. &nbsp;Of course when they got to snoring we had
a long gabble, and I told Jim everything.</p>

CHAPTER XXXI.</p>
<p>WE dasn't stop again at any town for days and days; kept right
along down the river. &nbsp;We was down south in the warm weather
now, and a mighty long ways from home. &nbsp;We begun to come to
trees with Spanish moss on them, hanging down from the limbs like
long, gray beards. &nbsp;It was the first I ever see it growing,
and it made the woods look solemn and dismal. &nbsp;So now the
frauds reckoned they was out of danger, and they begun to work the
villages again.</p>
<p>First they done a lecture on temperance; but they didn't make
enough for them both to get drunk on. &nbsp;Then in another village
they started a dancing-school; but they didn't know no more how to
dance than a kangaroo does; so the first prance they made the
general public jumped in and pranced them out of town.
&nbsp;Another time they tried to go at yellocution; but they didn't
yellocute long till the audience got up and give them a solid good
cussing, and made them skip out. &nbsp;They tackled missionarying,
and mesmerizing, and doctoring, and telling fortunes, and a little
of everything; but they couldn't seem to have no luck. &nbsp;So at
last they got just about dead broke, and laid around the raft as
she floated along, thinking and thinking, and never saying nothing,
by the half a day at a time, and dreadful blue and desperate.</p>
<p>And at last they took a change and begun to lay their heads
together in the wigwam and talk low and confidential two or three
hours at a time. Jim and me got uneasy. &nbsp;We didn't like the
look of it. &nbsp;We judged they was studying up some kind of worse
deviltry than ever. &nbsp;We turned it over and over, and at last
we made up our minds they was going to break into somebody's house
or store, or was going into the counterfeit-money business, or
something. So then we was pretty scared, and made up an agreement
that we wouldn't have nothing in the world to do with such actions,
and if we ever got the least show we would give them the cold shake
and clear out and leave them behind. Well, early one morning we hid
the raft in a good, safe place about two mile below a little bit of
a shabby village named Pikesville, and the king he went ashore and
told us all to stay hid whilst he went up to town and smelt around
to see if anybody had got any wind of the Royal Nonesuch there yet.
("House to rob, you MEAN," says I to myself; "and when you get
through robbing it you'll come back here and wonder what has become
of me and Jim and the raft&mdash;and you'll have to take it out in
wondering.") And he said if he warn't back by midday the duke and
me would know it was all right, and we was to come along.</p>
<p>So we stayed where we was. &nbsp;The duke he fretted and sweated
around, and was in a mighty sour way. &nbsp;He scolded us for
everything, and we couldn't seem to do nothing right; he found
fault with every little thing. Something was a-brewing, sure.
&nbsp;I was good and glad when midday come and no king; we could
have a change, anyway&mdash;and maybe a chance for THE change on
top of it. &nbsp;So me and the duke went up to the village, and
hunted around there for the king, and by and by we found him in the
back room of a little low doggery, very tight, and a lot of loafers
bullyragging him for sport, and he a-cussing and a-threatening with
all his might, and so tight he couldn't walk, and couldn't do
nothing to them. &nbsp;The duke he begun to abuse him for an old
fool, and the king begun to sass back, and the minute they was
fairly at it I lit out and shook the reefs out of my hind legs, and
spun down the river road like a deer, for I see our chance; and I
made up my mind that it would be a long day before they ever see me
and Jim again. &nbsp;I got down there all out of breath but loaded
up with joy, and sung out:</p>
<p>"Set her loose, Jim! we're all right now!"</p>
<p>But there warn't no answer, and nobody come out of the wigwam.
&nbsp;Jim was gone! &nbsp;I set up a shout&mdash;and then
another&mdash;and then another one; and run this way and that in
the woods, whooping and screeching; but it warn't no use&mdash;old
Jim was gone. &nbsp;Then I set down and cried; I couldn't help it.
But I couldn't set still long. &nbsp;Pretty soon I went out on the
road, trying to think what I better do, and I run across a boy
walking, and asked him if he'd seen a strange nigger dressed so and
so, and he says:</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>"Whereabouts?" says I.</p>
<p>"Down to Silas Phelps' place, two mile below here. &nbsp;He's a
runaway nigger, and they've got him. &nbsp;Was you looking for
him?"</p>
<p>"You bet I ain't! &nbsp;I run across him in the woods about an
hour or two ago, and he said if I hollered he'd cut my livers
out&mdash;and told me to lay down and stay where I was; and I done
it. &nbsp;Been there ever since; afeard to come out."</p>
<p>"Well," he says, "you needn't be afeard no more, becuz they've
got him. He run off f'm down South, som'ers."</p>
<p>"It's a good job they got him."</p>
<p>"Well, I RECKON! &nbsp;There's two hunderd dollars reward on
him. &nbsp;It's like picking up money out'n the road."</p>
<p>"Yes, it is&mdash;and I could a had it if I'd been big enough; I
see him FIRST. Who nailed him?"</p>

<br />
<br />
<br />
<p>"It was an old fellow&mdash;a stranger&mdash;and he sold out his
chance in him for forty dollars, becuz he's got to go up the river
and can't wait. &nbsp;Think o' that, now! &nbsp;You bet I'D wait,
if it was seven year."</p>
<p>"That's me, every time," says I. &nbsp;"But maybe his chance
ain't worth no more than that, if he'll sell it so cheap.
&nbsp;Maybe there's something ain't straight about it."</p>
<p>"But it IS, though&mdash;straight as a string. &nbsp;I see the
handbill myself. &nbsp;It tells all about him, to a
dot&mdash;paints him like a picture, and tells the plantation he's
frum, below NewrLEANS. &nbsp;No-sirree-BOB, they ain't no trouble
'bout THAT speculation, you bet you. &nbsp;Say, gimme a chaw
tobacker, won't ye?"</p>
<p>I didn't have none, so he left. &nbsp;I went to the raft, and
set down in the wigwam to think. &nbsp;But I couldn't come to
nothing. &nbsp;I thought till I wore my head sore, but I couldn't
see no way out of the trouble. &nbsp;After all this long journey,
and after all we'd done for them scoundrels, here it was all come
to nothing, everything all busted up and ruined, because they could
have the heart to serve Jim such a trick as that, and make him a
slave again all his life, and amongst strangers, too, for forty
dirty dollars.</p>
<p>Once I said to myself it would be a thousand times better for
Jim to be a slave at home where his family was, as long as he'd GOT
to be a slave, and so I'd better write a letter to Tom Sawyer and
tell him to tell Miss Watson where he was. &nbsp;But I soon give up
that notion for two things: she'd be mad and disgusted at his
rascality and ungratefulness for leaving her, and so she'd sell him
straight down the river again; and if she didn't, everybody
naturally despises an ungrateful nigger, and they'd make Jim feel
it all the time, and so he'd feel ornery and disgraced. And then
think of ME! &nbsp;It would get all around that Huck Finn helped a
nigger to get his freedom; and if I was ever to see anybody from
that town again I'd be ready to get down and lick his boots for
shame. &nbsp;That's just the way: &nbsp;a person does a low-down
thing, and then he don't want to take no consequences of it. Thinks
as long as he can hide it, it ain't no disgrace. &nbsp;That was my
fix exactly. The more I studied about this the more my conscience
went to grinding me, and the more wicked and low-down and ornery I
got to feeling. And at last, when it hit me all of a sudden that
here was the plain hand of Providence slapping me in the face and
letting me know my wickedness was being watched all the time from
up there in heaven, whilst I was stealing a poor old woman's nigger
that hadn't ever done me no harm, and now was showing me there's
One that's always on the lookout, and ain't a-going to allow no
such miserable doings to go only just so fur and no further, I most
dropped in my tracks I was so scared. &nbsp;Well, I tried the best
I could to kinder soften it up somehow for myself by saying I was
brung up wicked, and so I warn't so much to blame; but something
inside of me kept saying, "There was the Sunday-school, you could a
gone to it; and if you'd a done it they'd a learnt you there that
people that acts as I'd been acting about that nigger goes to
everlasting fire."</p>
<p>It made me shiver. &nbsp;And I about made up my mind to pray,
and see if I couldn't try to quit being the kind of a boy I was and
be better. &nbsp;So I kneeled down. &nbsp;But the words wouldn't
come. &nbsp;Why wouldn't they? &nbsp;It warn't no use to try and
hide it from Him. &nbsp;Nor from ME, neither. &nbsp;I knowed very
well why they wouldn't come. &nbsp;It was because my heart warn't
right; it was because I warn't square; it was because I was playing
double. &nbsp;I was letting ON to give up sin, but away inside of
me I was holding on to the biggest one of all. &nbsp;I was trying
to make my mouth SAY I would do the right thing and the clean
thing, and go and write to that nigger's owner and tell where he
was; but deep down in me I knowed it was a lie, and He knowed it.
&nbsp;You can't pray a lie&mdash;I found that out.</p>
<p>So I was full of trouble, full as I could be; and didn't know
what to do. At last I had an idea; and I says, I'll go and write
the letter&mdash;and then see if I can pray. &nbsp;Why, it was
astonishing, the way I felt as light as a feather right straight
off, and my troubles all gone. &nbsp;So I got a piece of paper and
a pencil, all glad and excited, and set down and wrote:</p>
<p>Miss Watson, your runaway nigger Jim is down here two mile below
Pikesville, and Mr. Phelps has got him and he will give him up for
the reward if you send.</p>
<p>HUCK FINN.</p>

<br />
<br />
<p>I felt good and all washed clean of sin for the first time I had
ever felt so in my life, and I knowed I could pray now. &nbsp;But I
didn't do it straight off, but laid the paper down and set there
thinking&mdash;thinking how good it was all this happened so, and
how near I come to being lost and going to hell. &nbsp;And went on
thinking. &nbsp;And got to thinking over our trip down the river;
and I see Jim before me all the time: &nbsp;in the day and in the
night-time, sometimes moonlight, sometimes storms, and we
a-floating along, talking and singing and laughing. &nbsp;But
somehow I couldn't seem to strike no places to harden me against
him, but only the other kind. &nbsp;I'd see him standing my watch
on top of his'n, 'stead of calling me, so I could go on sleeping;
and see him how glad he was when I come back out of the fog; and
when I come to him again in the swamp, up there where the feud was;
and such-like times; and would always call me honey, and pet me and
do everything he could think of for me, and how good he always was;
and at last I struck the time I saved him by telling the men we had
small-pox aboard, and he was so grateful, and said I was the best
friend old Jim ever had in the world, and the ONLY one he's got
now; and then I happened to look around and see that paper.</p>
<p>It was a close place. &nbsp;I took it up, and held it in my
hand. &nbsp;I was a-trembling, because I'd got to decide, forever,
betwixt two things, and I knowed it. &nbsp;I studied a minute, sort
of holding my breath, and then says to myself:</p>
<p>"All right, then, I'll GO to hell"&mdash;and tore it up.</p>
<p>It was awful thoughts and awful words, but they was said.
&nbsp;And I let them stay said; and never thought no more about
reforming. &nbsp;I shoved the whole thing out of my head, and said
I would take up wickedness again, which was in my line, being brung
up to it, and the other warn't. &nbsp;And for a starter I would go
to work and steal Jim out of slavery again; and if I could think up
anything worse, I would do that, too; because as long as I was in,
and in for good, I might as well go the whole hog.</p>
<p>Then I set to thinking over how to get at it, and turned over
some considerable many ways in my mind; and at last fixed up a plan
that suited me. &nbsp;So then I took the bearings of a woody island
that was down the river a piece, and as soon as it was fairly dark
I crept out with my raft and went for it, and hid it there, and
then turned in. &nbsp;I slept the night through, and got up before
it was light, and had my breakfast, and put on my store clothes,
and tied up some others and one thing or another in a bundle, and
took the canoe and cleared for shore. &nbsp;I landed below where I
judged was Phelps's place, and hid my bundle in the woods, and then
filled up the canoe with water, and loaded rocks into her and sunk
her where I could find her again when I wanted her, about a quarter
of a mile below a little steam sawmill that was on the bank.</p>
<p>Then I struck up the road, and when I passed the mill I see a
sign on it, "Phelps's Sawmill," and when I come to the farm-houses,
two or three hundred yards further along, I kept my eyes peeled,
but didn't see nobody around, though it was good daylight now.
&nbsp;But I didn't mind, because I didn't want to see nobody just
yet&mdash;I only wanted to get the lay of the land. According to my
plan, I was going to turn up there from the village, not from
below. &nbsp;So I just took a look, and shoved along, straight for
town. Well, the very first man I see when I got there was the duke.
&nbsp;He was sticking up a bill for the Royal
Nonesuch&mdash;three-night performance&mdash;like that other time.
&nbsp;They had the cheek, them frauds! &nbsp;I was right on him
before I could shirk. &nbsp;He looked astonished, and says:</p>
<p>"Hel-LO! &nbsp;Where'd YOU come from?" &nbsp;Then he says, kind
of glad and eager, "Where's the raft?&mdash;got her in a good
place?"</p>
<p>I says:</p>
<p>"Why, that's just what I was going to ask your grace."</p>
<p>Then he didn't look so joyful, and says:</p>
<p>"What was your idea for asking ME?" he says.</p>
<p>"Well," I says, "when I see the king in that doggery yesterday I
says to myself, we can't get him home for hours, till he's soberer;
so I went a-loafing around town to put in the time and wait.
&nbsp;A man up and offered me ten cents to help him pull a skiff
over the river and back to fetch a sheep, and so I went along; but
when we was dragging him to the boat, and the man left me a-holt of
the rope and went behind him to shove him along, he was too strong
for me and jerked loose and run, and we after him. &nbsp;We didn't
have no dog, and so we had to chase him all over the country till
we tired him out. &nbsp;We never got him till dark; then we fetched
him over, and I started down for the raft. &nbsp;When I got there
and see it was gone, I says to myself, 'They've got into trouble
and had to leave; and they've took my nigger, which is the only
nigger I've got in the world, and now I'm in a strange country, and
ain't got no property no more, nor nothing, and no way to make my
living;' so I set down and cried. &nbsp;I slept in the woods all
night. &nbsp;But what DID become of the raft, then?&mdash;and
Jim&mdash;poor Jim!"</p>
<p>"Blamed if I know&mdash;that is, what's become of the raft.
&nbsp;That old fool had made a trade and got forty dollars, and
when we found him in the doggery the loafers had matched
half-dollars with him and got every cent but what he'd spent for
whisky; and when I got him home late last night and found the raft
gone, we said, 'That little rascal has stole our raft and shook us,
and run off down the river.'"</p>
<p>"I wouldn't shake my NIGGER, would I?&mdash;the only nigger I
had in the world, and the only property."</p>
<p>"We never thought of that. &nbsp;Fact is, I reckon we'd come to
consider him OUR nigger; yes, we did consider him so&mdash;goodness
knows we had trouble enough for him. &nbsp;So when we see the raft
was gone and we flat broke, there warn't anything for it but to try
the Royal Nonesuch another shake. And I've pegged along ever since,
dry as a powder-horn. &nbsp;Where's that ten cents? Give it
here."</p>

<br />
<br />
<br />
<p>I had considerable money, so I give him ten cents, but begged
him to spend it for something to eat, and give me some, because it
was all the money I had, and I hadn't had nothing to eat since
yesterday. &nbsp;He never said nothing. &nbsp;The next minute he
whirls on me and says:</p>
<p>"Do you reckon that nigger would blow on us? &nbsp;We'd skin him
if he done that!"</p>
<p>"How can he blow? &nbsp;Hain't he run off?"</p>
<p>"No! &nbsp;That old fool sold him, and never divided with me,
and the money's gone."</p>
<p>"SOLD him?" &nbsp;I says, and begun to cry; "why, he was MY
nigger, and that was my money. &nbsp;Where is he?&mdash;I want my
nigger."</p>
<p>"Well, you can't GET your nigger, that's all&mdash;so dry up
your blubbering. Looky here&mdash;do you think YOU'D venture to
blow on us? &nbsp;Blamed if I think I'd trust you. &nbsp;Why, if
you WAS to blow on us&mdash;"</p>
<p>He stopped, but I never see the duke look so ugly out of his
eyes before. I went on a-whimpering, and says:</p>
<p>"I don't want to blow on nobody; and I ain't got no time to
blow, nohow. I got to turn out and find my nigger."</p>
<p>He looked kinder bothered, and stood there with his bills
fluttering on his arm, thinking, and wrinkling up his forehead.
&nbsp;At last he says:</p>
<p>"I'll tell you something. &nbsp;We got to be here three days.
&nbsp;If you'll promise you won't blow, and won't let the nigger
blow, I'll tell you where to find him."</p>
<p>So I promised, and he says:</p>
<p>"A farmer by the name of Silas Ph&mdash;" and then he stopped.
&nbsp;You see, he started to tell me the truth; but when he stopped
that way, and begun to study and think again, I reckoned he was
changing his mind. &nbsp;And so he was. He wouldn't trust me; he
wanted to make sure of having me out of the way the whole three
days. &nbsp;So pretty soon he says:</p>
<p>"The man that bought him is named Abram Foster&mdash;Abram G.
Foster&mdash;and he lives forty mile back here in the country, on
the road to Lafayette."</p>
<p>"All right," I says, "I can walk it in three days. &nbsp;And
I'll start this very afternoon."</p>
<p>"No you wont, you'll start NOW; and don't you lose any time
about it, neither, nor do any gabbling by the way. &nbsp;Just keep
a tight tongue in your head and move right along, and then you
won't get into trouble with US, d'ye hear?"</p>
<p>That was the order I wanted, and that was the one I played for.
&nbsp;I wanted to be left free to work my plans.</p>
<p>"So clear out," he says; "and you can tell Mr. Foster whatever
you want to. Maybe you can get him to believe that Jim IS your
nigger&mdash;some idiots don't require documents&mdash;leastways
I've heard there's such down South here. &nbsp;And when you tell
him the handbill and the reward's bogus, maybe he'll believe you
when you explain to him what the idea was for getting 'em out.
&nbsp;Go 'long now, and tell him anything you want to; but mind you
don't work your jaw any BETWEEN here and there."</p>

<br />
<br />
<br />
<p>So I left, and struck for the back country. &nbsp;I didn't look
around, but I kinder felt like he was watching me. &nbsp;But I
knowed I could tire him out at that. &nbsp;I went straight out in
the country as much as a mile before I stopped; then I doubled back
through the woods towards Phelps'. &nbsp;I reckoned I better start
in on my plan straight off without fooling around, because I wanted
to stop Jim's mouth till these fellows could get away. &nbsp;I
didn't want no trouble with their kind. &nbsp;I'd seen all I wanted
to of them, and wanted to get entirely shut of them.</p>

CHAPTER XXXII.</p>
<p>WHEN I got there it was all still and Sunday-like, and hot and
sunshiny; the hands was gone to the fields; and there was them kind
of faint dronings of bugs and flies in the air that makes it seem
so lonesome and like everybody's dead and gone; and if a breeze
fans along and quivers the leaves it makes you feel mournful,
because you feel like it's spirits whispering&mdash;spirits that's
been dead ever so many years&mdash;and you always think they're
talking about YOU. &nbsp;As a general thing it makes a body wish HE
was dead, too, and done with it all.</p>
<p>Phelps' was one of these little one-horse cotton plantations,
and they all look alike. &nbsp;A rail fence round a two-acre yard;
a stile made out of logs sawed off and up-ended in steps, like
barrels of a different length, to climb over the fence with, and
for the women to stand on when they are going to jump on to a
horse; some sickly grass-patches in the big yard, but mostly it was
bare and smooth, like an old hat with the nap rubbed off; big
double log-house for the white folks&mdash;hewed logs, with the
chinks stopped up with mud or mortar, and these mud-stripes been
whitewashed some time or another; round-log kitchen, with a big
broad, open but roofed passage joining it to the house; log
smoke-house back of the kitchen; three little log nigger-cabins in
a row t'other side the smoke-house; one little hut all by itself
away down against the back fence, and some outbuildings down a
piece the other side; ash-hopper and big kettle to bile soap in by
the little hut; bench by the kitchen door, with bucket of water and
a gourd; hound asleep there in the sun; more hounds asleep round
about; about three shade trees away off in a corner; some currant
bushes and gooseberry bushes in one place by the fence; outside of
the fence a garden and a watermelon patch; then the cotton fields
begins, and after the fields the woods.</p>
<p>I went around and clumb over the back stile by the ash-hopper,
and started for the kitchen. &nbsp;When I got a little ways I heard
the dim hum of a spinning-wheel wailing along up and sinking along
down again; and then I knowed for certain I wished I was
dead&mdash;for that IS the lonesomest sound in the whole world.</p>
<p>I went right along, not fixing up any particular plan, but just
trusting to Providence to put the right words in my mouth when the
time come; for I'd noticed that Providence always did put the right
words in my mouth if I left it alone.</p>
<p>When I got half-way, first one hound and then another got up and
went for me, and of course I stopped and faced them, and kept
still. &nbsp;And such another powwow as they made! &nbsp;In a
quarter of a minute I was a kind of a hub of a wheel, as you may
say&mdash;spokes made out of dogs&mdash;circle of fifteen of them
packed together around me, with their necks and noses stretched up
towards me, a-barking and howling; and more a-coming; you could see
them sailing over fences and around corners from everywheres.</p>
<p>A nigger woman come tearing out of the kitchen with a
rolling-pin in her hand, singing out, "Begone YOU Tige! you Spot!
begone sah!" and she fetched first one and then another of them a
clip and sent them howling, and then the rest followed; and the
next second half of them come back, wagging their tails around me,
and making friends with me. &nbsp;There ain't no harm in a hound,
nohow.</p>
<p>And behind the woman comes a little nigger girl and two little
nigger boys without anything on but tow-linen shirts, and they hung
on to their mother's gown, and peeped out from behind her at me,
bashful, the way they always do. &nbsp;And here comes the white
woman running from the house, about forty-five or fifty year old,
bareheaded, and her spinning-stick in her hand; and behind her
comes her little white children, acting the same way the little
niggers was doing. &nbsp;She was smiling all over so she could
hardly stand&mdash;and says:</p>
<p>"It's YOU, at last!&mdash;AIN'T it?"</p>
<p>I out with a "Yes'm" before I thought.</p>
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<a name="c32-279" id="c32-279"></a><br />

<img alt="c32-279.jpg (55K)" src="images/c32-279.jpg" height="560"
width="453" /><br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<p>She grabbed me and hugged me tight; and then gripped me by both
hands and shook and shook; and the tears come in her eyes, and run
down over; and she couldn't seem to hug and shake enough, and kept
saying, "You don't look as much like your mother as I reckoned you
would; but law sakes, I don't care for that, I'm so glad to see
you! &nbsp;Dear, dear, it does seem like I could eat you up!
&nbsp;Children, it's your cousin Tom!&mdash;tell him howdy."</p>
<p>But they ducked their heads, and put their fingers in their
mouths, and hid behind her. &nbsp;So she run on:</p>
<p>"Lize, hurry up and get him a hot breakfast right away&mdash;or
did you get your breakfast on the boat?"</p>
<p>I said I had got it on the boat. &nbsp;So then she started for
the house, leading me by the hand, and the children tagging after.
&nbsp;When we got there she set me down in a split-bottomed chair,
and set herself down on a little low stool in front of me, holding
both of my hands, and says:</p>
<p>"Now I can have a GOOD look at you; and, laws-a-me, I've been
hungry for it a many and a many a time, all these long years, and
it's come at last! We been expecting you a couple of days and more.
&nbsp;What kep' you?&mdash;boat get aground?"</p>
<p>"Yes'm&mdash;she&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Don't say yes'm&mdash;say Aunt Sally. &nbsp;Where'd she get
aground?"</p>
<p>I didn't rightly know what to say, because I didn't know whether
the boat would be coming up the river or down. &nbsp;But I go a
good deal on instinct; and my instinct said she would be coming
up&mdash;from down towards Orleans. That didn't help me much,
though; for I didn't know the names of bars down that way. &nbsp;I
see I'd got to invent a bar, or forget the name of the one we got
aground on&mdash;or&mdash;Now I struck an idea, and fetched it
out:</p>
<p>"It warn't the grounding&mdash;that didn't keep us back but a
little. &nbsp;We blowed out a cylinder-head."</p>
<p>"Good gracious! anybody hurt?"</p>
<p>"No'm. &nbsp;Killed a nigger."</p>
<p>"Well, it's lucky; because sometimes people do get hurt.
&nbsp;Two years ago last Christmas your uncle Silas was coming up
from Newrleans on the old Lally Rook, and she blowed out a
cylinder-head and crippled a man. &nbsp;And I think he died
afterwards. &nbsp;He was a Baptist. &nbsp;Your uncle Silas knowed a
family in Baton Rouge that knowed his people very well. &nbsp;Yes,
I remember now, he DID die. &nbsp;Mortification set in, and they
had to amputate him. But it didn't save him. &nbsp;Yes, it was
mortification&mdash;that was it. &nbsp;He turned blue all over, and
died in the hope of a glorious resurrection. They say he was a
sight to look at. &nbsp;Your uncle's been up to the town every day
to fetch you. And he's gone again, not more'n an hour ago; he'll be
back any minute now. You must a met him on the road, didn't
you?&mdash;oldish man, with a&mdash;"</p>
<p>"No, I didn't see nobody, Aunt Sally. &nbsp;The boat landed just
at daylight, and I left my baggage on the wharf-boat and went
looking around the town and out a piece in the country, to put in
the time and not get here too soon; and so I come down the back
way."</p>
<p>"Who'd you give the baggage to?"</p>
<p>"Nobody."</p>
<p>"Why, child, it 'll be stole!"</p>
<p>"Not where I hid it I reckon it won't," I says.</p>
<p>"How'd you get your breakfast so early on the boat?"</p>
<p>It was kinder thin ice, but I says:</p>
<p>"The captain see me standing around, and told me I better have
something to eat before I went ashore; so he took me in the texas
to the officers' lunch, and give me all I wanted."</p>
<p>I was getting so uneasy I couldn't listen good. &nbsp;I had my
mind on the children all the time; I wanted to get them out to one
side and pump them a little, and find out who I was. &nbsp;But I
couldn't get no show, Mrs. Phelps kept it up and run on so.
&nbsp;Pretty soon she made the cold chills streak all down my back,
because she says:</p>
<p>"But here we're a-running on this way, and you hain't told me a
word about Sis, nor any of them. &nbsp;Now I'll rest my works a
little, and you start up yourn; just tell me EVERYTHING&mdash;tell
me all about 'm all every one of 'm; and how they are, and what
they're doing, and what they told you to tell me; and every last
thing you can think of."</p>
<p>Well, I see I was up a stump&mdash;and up it good.
&nbsp;Providence had stood by me this fur all right, but I was hard
and tight aground now. &nbsp;I see it warn't a bit of use to try to
go ahead&mdash;I'd got to throw up my hand. &nbsp;So I says to
myself, here's another place where I got to resk the truth. &nbsp;I
opened my mouth to begin; but she grabbed me and hustled me in
behind the bed, and says:</p>
<p>"Here he comes! &nbsp;Stick your head down lower&mdash;there,
that'll do; you can't be seen now. &nbsp;Don't you let on you're
here. &nbsp;I'll play a joke on him. Children, don't you say a
word."</p>
<p>I see I was in a fix now. &nbsp;But it warn't no use to worry;
there warn't nothing to do but just hold still, and try and be
ready to stand from under when the lightning struck.</p>
<p>I had just one little glimpse of the old gentleman when he come
in; then the bed hid him. &nbsp;Mrs. Phelps she jumps for him, and
says:</p>
<p>"Has he come?"</p>
<p>"No," says her husband.</p>
<p>"Good-NESS gracious!" she says, "what in the warld can have
become of him?"</p>
<p>"I can't imagine," says the old gentleman; "and I must say it
makes me dreadful uneasy."</p>
<p>"Uneasy!" she says; "I'm ready to go distracted! &nbsp;He MUST a
come; and you've missed him along the road. &nbsp;I KNOW it's
so&mdash;something tells me so."</p>
<p>"Why, Sally, I COULDN'T miss him along the road&mdash;YOU know
that."</p>
<p>"But oh, dear, dear, what WILL Sis say! &nbsp;He must a come!
&nbsp;You must a missed him. &nbsp;He&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Oh, don't distress me any more'n I'm already distressed.
&nbsp;I don't know what in the world to make of it. &nbsp;I'm at my
wit's end, and I don't mind acknowledging 't I'm right down scared.
&nbsp;But there's no hope that he's come; for he COULDN'T come and
me miss him. &nbsp;Sally, it's terrible&mdash;just
terrible&mdash;something's happened to the boat, sure!"</p>
<p>"Why, Silas! &nbsp;Look yonder!&mdash;up the road!&mdash;ain't
that somebody coming?"</p>
<p>He sprung to the window at the head of the bed, and that give
Mrs. Phelps the chance she wanted. &nbsp;She stooped down quick at
the foot of the bed and give me a pull, and out I come; and when he
turned back from the window there she stood, a-beaming and
a-smiling like a house afire, and I standing pretty meek and sweaty
alongside. &nbsp;The old gentleman stared, and says:</p>
<p>"Why, who's that?"</p>
<p>"Who do you reckon 't is?"</p>

<br />
<br />
<br />
<p>"I hain't no idea. &nbsp;Who IS it?"</p>
<p>"It's TOM SAWYER!"</p>
<p>By jings, I most slumped through the floor! &nbsp;But there
warn't no time to swap knives; the old man grabbed me by the hand
and shook, and kept on shaking; and all the time how the woman did
dance around and laugh and cry; and then how they both did fire off
questions about Sid, and Mary, and the rest of the tribe.</p>
<p>But if they was joyful, it warn't nothing to what I was; for it
was like being born again, I was so glad to find out who I was.
&nbsp;Well, they froze to me for two hours; and at last, when my
chin was so tired it couldn't hardly go any more, I had told them
more about my family&mdash;I mean the Sawyer family&mdash;than ever
happened to any six Sawyer families. &nbsp;And I explained all
about how we blowed out a cylinder-head at the mouth of White
River, and it took us three days to fix it. &nbsp;Which was all
right, and worked first-rate; because THEY didn't know but what it
would take three days to fix it. &nbsp;If I'd a called it a
bolthead it would a done just as well.</p>
<p>Now I was feeling pretty comfortable all down one side, and
pretty uncomfortable all up the other. &nbsp;Being Tom Sawyer was
easy and comfortable, and it stayed easy and comfortable till by
and by I hear a steamboat coughing along down the river. &nbsp;Then
I says to myself, s'pose Tom Sawyer comes down on that boat?
&nbsp;And s'pose he steps in here any minute, and sings out my name
before I can throw him a wink to keep quiet?</p>
<p>Well, I couldn't HAVE it that way; it wouldn't do at all.
&nbsp;I must go up the road and waylay him. &nbsp;So I told the
folks I reckoned I would go up to the town and fetch down my
baggage. &nbsp;The old gentleman was for going along with me, but I
said no, I could drive the horse myself, and I druther he wouldn't
take no trouble about me.</p>

CHAPTER XXXIII.</p>
<p>SO I started for town in the wagon, and when I was half-way I
see a wagon coming, and sure enough it was Tom Sawyer, and I
stopped and waited till he come along. &nbsp;I says "Hold on!" and
it stopped alongside, and his mouth opened up like a trunk, and
stayed so; and he swallowed two or three times like a person that's
got a dry throat, and then says:</p>
<p>"I hain't ever done you no harm. &nbsp;You know that. &nbsp;So,
then, what you want to come back and ha'nt ME for?"</p>
<p>I says:</p>
<p>"I hain't come back&mdash;I hain't been GONE."</p>
<p>When he heard my voice it righted him up some, but he warn't
quite satisfied yet. &nbsp;He says:</p>
<p>"Don't you play nothing on me, because I wouldn't on you.
&nbsp;Honest injun now, you ain't a ghost?"</p>
<p>"Honest injun, I ain't," I says.</p>
<p>"Well&mdash;I&mdash;I&mdash;well, that ought to settle it, of
course; but I can't somehow seem to understand it no way.
&nbsp;Looky here, warn't you ever murdered AT ALL?"</p>
<p>"No. &nbsp;I warn't ever murdered at all&mdash;I played it on
them. &nbsp;You come in here and feel of me if you don't believe
me."</p>
<p>So he done it; and it satisfied him; and he was that glad to see
me again he didn't know what to do. &nbsp;And he wanted to know all
about it right off, because it was a grand adventure, and
mysterious, and so it hit him where he lived. &nbsp;But I said,
leave it alone till by and by; and told his driver to wait, and we
drove off a little piece, and I told him the kind of a fix I was
in, and what did he reckon we better do? &nbsp;He said, let him
alone a minute, and don't disturb him. &nbsp;So he thought and
thought, and pretty soon he says:</p>
<p>"It's all right; I've got it. &nbsp;Take my trunk in your wagon,
and let on it's your'n; and you turn back and fool along slow, so
as to get to the house about the time you ought to; and I'll go
towards town a piece, and take a fresh start, and get there a
quarter or a half an hour after you; and you needn't let on to know
me at first."</p>
<p>I says:</p>
<p>"All right; but wait a minute. &nbsp;There's one more
thing&mdash;a thing that NOBODY don't know but me. &nbsp;And that
is, there's a nigger here that I'm a-trying to steal out of
slavery, and his name is JIM&mdash;old Miss Watson's Jim."</p>
<p>He says:</p>
<p>"What! &nbsp;Why, Jim is&mdash;"</p>
<p>He stopped and went to studying. &nbsp;I says:</p>
<p>"I know what you'll say. &nbsp;You'll say it's dirty, low-down
business; but what if it is? &nbsp;I'm low down; and I'm a-going to
steal him, and I want you keep mum and not let on. &nbsp;Will
you?"</p>
<p>His eye lit up, and he says:</p>
<p>"I'll HELP you steal him!"</p>
<p>Well, I let go all holts then, like I was shot. &nbsp;It was the
most astonishing speech I ever heard&mdash;and I'm bound to say Tom
Sawyer fell considerable in my estimation. &nbsp;Only I couldn't
believe it. &nbsp;Tom Sawyer a NIGGER-STEALER!</p>
<p>"Oh, shucks!" &nbsp;I says; "you're joking."</p>
<p>"I ain't joking, either."</p>
<p>"Well, then," I says, "joking or no joking, if you hear anything
said about a runaway nigger, don't forget to remember that YOU
don't know nothing about him, and I don't know nothing about
him."</p>
<p>Then we took the trunk and put it in my wagon, and he drove off
his way and I drove mine. &nbsp;But of course I forgot all about
driving slow on accounts of being glad and full of thinking; so I
got home a heap too quick for that length of a trip. &nbsp;The old
gentleman was at the door, and he says:</p>
<p>"Why, this is wonderful! &nbsp;Whoever would a thought it was in
that mare to do it? &nbsp;I wish we'd a timed her. &nbsp;And she
hain't sweated a hair&mdash;not a hair. It's wonderful. &nbsp;Why,
I wouldn't take a hundred dollars for that horse now&mdash;I
wouldn't, honest; and yet I'd a sold her for fifteen before, and
thought 'twas all she was worth."</p>
<p>That's all he said. &nbsp;He was the innocentest, best old soul
I ever see. But it warn't surprising; because he warn't only just a
farmer, he was a preacher, too, and had a little one-horse log
church down back of the plantation, which he built it himself at
his own expense, for a church and schoolhouse, and never charged
nothing for his preaching, and it was worth it, too. &nbsp;There
was plenty other farmer-preachers like that, and done the same way,
down South.</p>
<p>In about half an hour Tom's wagon drove up to the front stile,
and Aunt Sally she see it through the window, because it was only
about fifty yards, and says:</p>
<p>"Why, there's somebody come! &nbsp;I wonder who 'tis? &nbsp;Why,
I do believe it's a stranger. &nbsp;Jimmy" (that's one of the
children) "run and tell Lize to put on another plate for
dinner."</p>
<p>Everybody made a rush for the front door, because, of course, a
stranger don't come EVERY year, and so he lays over the
yaller-fever, for interest, when he does come. &nbsp;Tom was over
the stile and starting for the house; the wagon was spinning up the
road for the village, and we was all bunched in the front door.
&nbsp;Tom had his store clothes on, and an audience&mdash;and that
was always nuts for Tom Sawyer. &nbsp;In them circumstances it
warn't no trouble to him to throw in an amount of style that was
suitable. &nbsp;He warn't a boy to meeky along up that yard like a
sheep; no, he come ca'm and important, like the ram. &nbsp;When he
got a-front of us he lifts his hat ever so gracious and dainty,
like it was the lid of a box that had butterflies asleep in it and
he didn't want to disturb them, and says:</p>
<p>"Mr. Archibald Nichols, I presume?"</p>
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<a name="c33-287" id="c33-287"></a><br />
<br />
<img alt="c33-287.jpg (42K)" src="images/c33-287.jpg" height="504"
width="380" /><br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<p>"No, my boy," says the old gentleman, "I'm sorry to say 't your
driver has deceived you; Nichols's place is down a matter of three
mile more. Come in, come in."</p>
<p>Tom he took a look back over his shoulder, and says, "Too
late&mdash;he's out of sight."</p>
<p>"Yes, he's gone, my son, and you must come in and eat your
dinner with us; and then we'll hitch up and take you down to
Nichols's."</p>
<p>"Oh, I CAN'T make you so much trouble; I couldn't think of it.
&nbsp;I'll walk&mdash;I don't mind the distance."</p>
<p>"But we won't LET you walk&mdash;it wouldn't be Southern
hospitality to do it. Come right in."</p>
<p>"Oh, DO," says Aunt Sally; "it ain't a bit of trouble to us, not
a bit in the world. &nbsp;You must stay. &nbsp;It's a long, dusty
three mile, and we can't let you walk. &nbsp;And, besides, I've
already told 'em to put on another plate when I see you coming; so
you mustn't disappoint us. &nbsp;Come right in and make yourself at
home."</p>
<p>So Tom he thanked them very hearty and handsome, and let himself
be persuaded, and come in; and when he was in he said he was a
stranger from Hicksville, Ohio, and his name was William
Thompson&mdash;and he made another bow.</p>
<p>Well, he run on, and on, and on, making up stuff about
Hicksville and everybody in it he could invent, and I getting a
little nervious, and wondering how this was going to help me out of
my scrape; and at last, still talking along, he reached over and
kissed Aunt Sally right on the mouth, and then settled back again
in his chair comfortable, and was going on talking; but she jumped
up and wiped it off with the back of her hand, and says:</p>
<p>"You owdacious puppy!"</p>
<p>He looked kind of hurt, and says:</p>
<p>"I'm surprised at you, m'am."</p>
<p>"You're s'rp&mdash;Why, what do you reckon I am? &nbsp;I've a
good notion to take and&mdash;Say, what do you mean by kissing
me?"</p>
<p>He looked kind of humble, and says:</p>
<p>"I didn't mean nothing, m'am. &nbsp;I didn't mean no harm.
&nbsp;I&mdash;I&mdash;thought you'd like it."</p>
<p>"Why, you born fool!" &nbsp;She took up the spinning stick, and
it looked like it was all she could do to keep from giving him a
crack with it. &nbsp;"What made you think I'd like it?"</p>
<p>"Well, I don't know. &nbsp;Only, they&mdash;they&mdash;told me
you would."</p>
<p>"THEY told you I would. &nbsp;Whoever told you's ANOTHER
lunatic. &nbsp;I never heard the beat of it. &nbsp;Who's THEY?"</p>
<p>"Why, everybody. &nbsp;They all said so, m'am."</p>
<p>It was all she could do to hold in; and her eyes snapped, and
her fingers worked like she wanted to scratch him; and she
says:</p>
<p>"Who's 'everybody'? &nbsp;Out with their names, or ther'll be an
idiot short."</p>
<p>He got up and looked distressed, and fumbled his hat, and
says:</p>
<p>"I'm sorry, and I warn't expecting it. &nbsp;They told me to.
&nbsp;They all told me to. &nbsp;They all said, kiss her; and said
she'd like it. &nbsp;They all said it&mdash;every one of them.
&nbsp;But I'm sorry, m'am, and I won't do it no more&mdash;I won't,
honest."</p>
<p>"You won't, won't you? &nbsp;Well, I sh'd RECKON you won't!"</p>
<p>"No'm, I'm honest about it; I won't ever do it again&mdash;till
you ask me."</p>
<p>"Till I ASK you! &nbsp;Well, I never see the beat of it in my
born days! &nbsp;I lay you'll be the Methusalem-numskull of
creation before ever I ask you&mdash;or the likes of you."</p>
<p>"Well," he says, "it does surprise me so. &nbsp;I can't make it
out, somehow. They said you would, and I thought you would.
&nbsp;But&mdash;" He stopped and looked around slow, like he wished
he could run across a friendly eye somewheres, and fetched up on
the old gentleman's, and says, "Didn't YOU think she'd like me to
kiss her, sir?"</p>
<p>"Why, no; I&mdash;I&mdash;well, no, I b'lieve I didn't."</p>
<p>Then he looks on around the same way to me, and says:</p>
<p>"Tom, didn't YOU think Aunt Sally 'd open out her arms and say,
'Sid Sawyer&mdash;'"</p>
<p>"My land!" she says, breaking in and jumping for him, "you
impudent young rascal, to fool a body so&mdash;" and was going to
hug him, but he fended her off, and says:</p>
<p>"No, not till you've asked me first."</p>
<p>So she didn't lose no time, but asked him; and hugged him and
kissed him over and over again, and then turned him over to the old
man, and he took what was left. &nbsp;And after they got a little
quiet again she says:</p>
<p>"Why, dear me, I never see such a surprise. &nbsp;We warn't
looking for YOU at all, but only Tom. &nbsp;Sis never wrote to me
about anybody coming but him."</p>
<p>"It's because it warn't INTENDED for any of us to come but Tom,"
he says; "but I begged and begged, and at the last minute she let
me come, too; so, coming down the river, me and Tom thought it
would be a first-rate surprise for him to come here to the house
first, and for me to by and by tag along and drop in, and let on to
be a stranger. &nbsp;But it was a mistake, Aunt Sally. &nbsp;This
ain't no healthy place for a stranger to come."</p>
<p>"No&mdash;not impudent whelps, Sid. &nbsp;You ought to had your
jaws boxed; I hain't been so put out since I don't know when.
&nbsp;But I don't care, I don't mind the terms&mdash;I'd be willing
to stand a thousand such jokes to have you here. Well, to think of
that performance! &nbsp;I don't deny it, I was most putrified with
astonishment when you give me that smack."</p>

<br />
<br />
<br />
<p>We had dinner out in that broad open passage betwixt the house
and the kitchen; and there was things enough on that table for
seven families&mdash;and all hot, too; none of your flabby, tough
meat that's laid in a cupboard in a damp cellar all night and
tastes like a hunk of old cold cannibal in the morning. &nbsp;Uncle
Silas he asked a pretty long blessing over it, but it was worth it;
and it didn't cool it a bit, neither, the way I've seen them kind
of interruptions do lots of times. &nbsp;There was a considerable
good deal of talk all the afternoon, and me and Tom was on the
lookout all the time; but it warn't no use, they didn't happen to
say nothing about any runaway nigger, and we was afraid to try to
work up to it. &nbsp;But at supper, at night, one of the little
boys says:</p>
<p>"Pa, mayn't Tom and Sid and me go to the show?"</p>
<p>"No," says the old man, "I reckon there ain't going to be any;
and you couldn't go if there was; because the runaway nigger told
Burton and me all about that scandalous show, and Burton said he
would tell the people; so I reckon they've drove the owdacious
loafers out of town before this time."</p>
<p>So there it was!&mdash;but I couldn't help it. &nbsp;Tom and me
was to sleep in the same room and bed; so, being tired, we bid
good-night and went up to bed right after supper, and clumb out of
the window and down the lightning-rod, and shoved for the town; for
I didn't believe anybody was going to give the king and the duke a
hint, and so if I didn't hurry up and give them one they'd get into
trouble sure.</p>
<p>On the road Tom he told me all about how it was reckoned I was
murdered, and how pap disappeared pretty soon, and didn't come back
no more, and what a stir there was when Jim run away; and I told
Tom all about our Royal Nonesuch rapscallions, and as much of the
raft voyage as I had time to; and as we struck into the town and up
through the the middle of it--it was as much as half-after eight,
then&mdash;here comes a raging rush of people with torches, and an
awful whooping and yelling, and banging tin pans and blowing horns;
and we jumped to one side to let them go by; and as they went by I
see they had the king and the duke astraddle of a rail&mdash;that
is, I knowed it WAS the king and the duke, though they was all over
tar and feathers, and didn't look like nothing in the world that
was human&mdash;just looked like a couple of monstrous big
soldier-plumes. &nbsp;Well, it made me sick to see it; and I was
sorry for them poor pitiful rascals, it seemed like I couldn't ever
feel any hardness against them any more in the world. &nbsp;It was
a dreadful thing to see. &nbsp;Human beings CAN be awful cruel to
one another.</p>

<br />
<br />
<p>We see we was too late&mdash;couldn't do no good. &nbsp;We asked
some stragglers about it, and they said everybody went to the show
looking very innocent; and laid low and kept dark till the poor old
king was in the middle of his cavortings on the stage; then
somebody give a signal, and the house rose up and went for
them.</p>
<p>So we poked along back home, and I warn't feeling so brash as I
was before, but kind of ornery, and humble, and to blame,
somehow&mdash;though I hadn't done nothing. &nbsp;But that's always
the way; it don't make no difference whether you do right or wrong,
a person's conscience ain't got no sense, and just goes for him
anyway. &nbsp;If I had a yaller dog that didn't know no more than a
person's conscience does I would pison him. It takes up more room
than all the rest of a person's insides, and yet ain't no good,
nohow. &nbsp;Tom Sawyer he says the same.</p>

CHAPTER XXXIV.</p>
<p>WE stopped talking, and got to thinking. &nbsp;By and by Tom
says:</p>
<p>"Looky here, Huck, what fools we are to not think of it before!
&nbsp;I bet I know where Jim is."</p>
<p>"No! &nbsp;Where?"</p>
<p>"In that hut down by the ash-hopper. &nbsp;Why, looky here.
&nbsp;When we was at dinner, didn't you see a nigger man go in
there with some vittles?"</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>"What did you think the vittles was for?"</p>
<p>"For a dog."</p>
<p>"So 'd I. Well, it wasn't for a dog."</p>
<p>"Why?"</p>
<p>"Because part of it was watermelon."</p>
<p>"So it was&mdash;I noticed it. &nbsp;Well, it does beat all that
I never thought about a dog not eating watermelon. &nbsp;It shows
how a body can see and don't see at the same time."</p>
<p>"Well, the nigger unlocked the padlock when he went in, and he
locked it again when he came out. &nbsp;He fetched uncle a key
about the time we got up from table&mdash;same key, I bet.
&nbsp;Watermelon shows man, lock shows prisoner; and it ain't
likely there's two prisoners on such a little plantation, and where
the people's all so kind and good. &nbsp;Jim's the prisoner.
&nbsp;All right&mdash;I'm glad we found it out detective fashion; I
wouldn't give shucks for any other way. &nbsp;Now you work your
mind, and study out a plan to steal Jim, and I will study out one,
too; and we'll take the one we like the best."</p>
<p>What a head for just a boy to have! &nbsp;If I had Tom Sawyer's
head I wouldn't trade it off to be a duke, nor mate of a steamboat,
nor clown in a circus, nor nothing I can think of. &nbsp;I went to
thinking out a plan, but only just to be doing something; I knowed
very well where the right plan was going to come from. &nbsp;Pretty
soon Tom says:</p>
<p>"Ready?"</p>
<p>"Yes," I says.</p>
<p>"All right&mdash;bring it out."</p>
<p>"My plan is this," I says. &nbsp;"We can easy find out if it's
Jim in there. Then get up my canoe to-morrow night, and fetch my
raft over from the island. &nbsp;Then the first dark night that
comes steal the key out of the old man's britches after he goes to
bed, and shove off down the river on the raft with Jim, hiding
daytimes and running nights, the way me and Jim used to do before.
&nbsp;Wouldn't that plan work?"</p>
<p>"WORK? &nbsp;Why, cert'nly it would work, like rats a-fighting.
&nbsp;But it's too blame' simple; there ain't nothing TO it.
&nbsp;What's the good of a plan that ain't no more trouble than
that? &nbsp;It's as mild as goose-milk. &nbsp;Why, Huck, it
wouldn't make no more talk than breaking into a soap factory."</p>
<p>I never said nothing, because I warn't expecting nothing
different; but I knowed mighty well that whenever he got HIS plan
ready it wouldn't have none of them objections to it.</p>
<p>And it didn't. &nbsp;He told me what it was, and I see in a
minute it was worth fifteen of mine for style, and would make Jim
just as free a man as mine would, and maybe get us all killed
besides. &nbsp;So I was satisfied, and said we would waltz in on
it. &nbsp;I needn't tell what it was here, because I knowed it
wouldn't stay the way, it was. &nbsp;I knowed he would be changing
it around every which way as we went along, and heaving in new
bullinesses wherever he got a chance. &nbsp;And that is what he
done.</p>
<p>Well, one thing was dead sure, and that was that Tom Sawyer was
in earnest, and was actuly going to help steal that nigger out of
slavery. That was the thing that was too many for me. &nbsp;Here
was a boy that was respectable and well brung up; and had a
character to lose; and folks at home that had characters; and he
was bright and not leather-headed; and knowing and not ignorant;
and not mean, but kind; and yet here he was, without any more
pride, or rightness, or feeling, than to stoop to this business,
and make himself a shame, and his family a shame, before everybody.
&nbsp;I COULDN'T understand it no way at all. &nbsp;It was
outrageous, and I knowed I ought to just up and tell him so; and so
be his true friend, and let him quit the thing right where he was
and save himself. And I DID start to tell him; but he shut me up,
and says:</p>
<p>"Don't you reckon I know what I'm about? &nbsp;Don't I generly
know what I'm about?"</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>"Didn't I SAY I was going to help steal the nigger?"</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>"WELL, then."</p>
<p>That's all he said, and that's all I said. &nbsp;It warn't no
use to say any more; because when he said he'd do a thing, he
always done it. &nbsp;But I couldn't make out how he was willing to
go into this thing; so I just let it go, and never bothered no more
about it. &nbsp;If he was bound to have it so, I couldn't help
it.</p>
<p>When we got home the house was all dark and still; so we went on
down to the hut by the ash-hopper for to examine it. &nbsp;We went
through the yard so as to see what the hounds would do. &nbsp;They
knowed us, and didn't make no more noise than country dogs is
always doing when anything comes by in the night. &nbsp;When we got
to the cabin we took a look at the front and the two sides; and on
the side I warn't acquainted with&mdash;which was the north
side&mdash;we found a square window-hole, up tolerable high, with
just one stout board nailed across it. &nbsp;I says:</p>
<p>"Here's the ticket. &nbsp;This hole's big enough for Jim to get
through if we wrench off the board."</p>
<p>Tom says:</p>
<p>"It's as simple as tit-tat-toe, three-in-a-row, and as easy as
playing hooky. &nbsp;I should HOPE we can find a way that's a
little more complicated than THAT, Huck Finn."</p>

<br />
<br />
<p>"Well, then," I says, "how 'll it do to saw him out, the way I
done before I was murdered that time?"</p>
<p>"That's more LIKE," he says. &nbsp;"It's real mysterious, and
troublesome, and good," he says; "but I bet we can find a way
that's twice as long. &nbsp;There ain't no hurry; le's keep on
looking around."</p>
<p>Betwixt the hut and the fence, on the back side, was a lean-to
that joined the hut at the eaves, and was made out of plank.
&nbsp;It was as long as the hut, but narrow&mdash;only about six
foot wide. &nbsp;The door to it was at the south end, and was
padlocked. &nbsp;Tom he went to the soap-kettle and searched
around, and fetched back the iron thing they lift the lid with; so
he took it and prized out one of the staples. &nbsp;The chain fell
down, and we opened the door and went in, and shut it, and struck a
match, and see the shed was only built against a cabin and hadn't
no connection with it; and there warn't no floor to the shed, nor
nothing in it but some old rusty played-out hoes and spades and
picks and a crippled plow. &nbsp;The match went out, and so did we,
and shoved in the staple again, and the door was locked as good as
ever. Tom was joyful. &nbsp;He says;</p>
<p>"Now we're all right. &nbsp;We'll DIG him out. &nbsp;It 'll take
about a week!"</p>
<p>Then we started for the house, and I went in the back
door&mdash;you only have to pull a buckskin latch-string, they
don't fasten the doors&mdash;but that warn't romantical enough for
Tom Sawyer; no way would do him but he must climb up the
lightning-rod. &nbsp;But after he got up half way about three
times, and missed fire and fell every time, and the last time most
busted his brains out, he thought he'd got to give it up; but after
he was rested he allowed he would give her one more turn for luck,
and this time he made the trip.</p>
<p>In the morning we was up at break of day, and down to the nigger
cabins to pet the dogs and make friends with the nigger that fed
Jim&mdash;if it WAS Jim that was being fed. &nbsp;The niggers was
just getting through breakfast and starting for the fields; and
Jim's nigger was piling up a tin pan with bread and meat and
things; and whilst the others was leaving, the key come from the
house.</p>
<p>This nigger had a good-natured, chuckle-headed face, and his
wool was all tied up in little bunches with thread. &nbsp;That was
to keep witches off. &nbsp;He said the witches was pestering him
awful these nights, and making him see all kinds of strange things,
and hear all kinds of strange words and noises, and he didn't
believe he was ever witched so long before in his life. &nbsp;He
got so worked up, and got to running on so about his troubles, he
forgot all about what he'd been a-going to do. &nbsp;So Tom
says:</p>
<p>"What's the vittles for? &nbsp;Going to feed the dogs?"</p>
<p>The nigger kind of smiled around gradually over his face, like
when you heave a brickbat in a mud-puddle, and he says:</p>
<p>"Yes, Mars Sid, A dog. &nbsp;Cur'us dog, too. &nbsp;Does you
want to go en look at 'im?"</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>I hunched Tom, and whispers:</p>
<p>"You going, right here in the daybreak? &nbsp;THAT warn't the
plan."</p>
<p>"No, it warn't; but it's the plan NOW."</p>
<p>So, drat him, we went along, but I didn't like it much.
&nbsp;When we got in we couldn't hardly see anything, it was so
dark; but Jim was there, sure enough, and could see us; and he
sings out:</p>
<p>"Why, HUCK! &nbsp;En good LAN'! ain' dat Misto Tom?"</p>
<p>I just knowed how it would be; I just expected it. &nbsp;I
didn't know nothing to do; and if I had I couldn't a done it,
because that nigger busted in and says:</p>
<p>"Why, de gracious sakes! do he know you genlmen?"</p>
<p>We could see pretty well now. &nbsp;Tom he looked at the nigger,
steady and kind of wondering, and says:</p>
<p>"Does WHO know us?"</p>
<p>"Why, dis-yer runaway nigger."</p>
<p>"I don't reckon he does; but what put that into your head?"</p>
<p>"What PUT it dar? &nbsp;Didn' he jis' dis minute sing out like
he knowed you?"</p>
<p>Tom says, in a puzzled-up kind of way:</p>
<p>"Well, that's mighty curious. &nbsp;WHO sung out? WHEN did he
sing out? &nbsp;WHAT did he sing out?" And turns to me, perfectly
ca'm, and says, "Did YOU hear anybody sing out?"</p>
<p>Of course there warn't nothing to be said but the one thing; so
I says:</p>
<p>"No; I ain't heard nobody say nothing."</p>
<p>Then he turns to Jim, and looks him over like he never see him
before, and says:</p>
<p>"Did you sing out?"</p>
<p>"No, sah," says Jim; "I hain't said nothing, sah."</p>
<p>"Not a word?"</p>
<p>"No, sah, I hain't said a word."</p>
<p>"Did you ever see us before?"</p>
<p>"No, sah; not as I knows on."</p>
<p>So Tom turns to the nigger, which was looking wild and
distressed, and says, kind of severe:</p>
<p>"What do you reckon's the matter with you, anyway? &nbsp;What
made you think somebody sung out?"</p>
<p>"Oh, it's de dad-blame' witches, sah, en I wisht I was dead, I
do. &nbsp;Dey's awluz at it, sah, en dey do mos' kill me, dey
sk'yers me so. &nbsp;Please to don't tell nobody 'bout it sah, er
ole Mars Silas he'll scole me; 'kase he say dey AIN'T no witches.
&nbsp;I jis' wish to goodness he was heah now&mdash;DEN what would
he say! &nbsp;I jis' bet he couldn' fine no way to git aroun' it
DIS time. &nbsp;But it's awluz jis' so; people dat's SOT, stays
sot; dey won't look into noth'n'en fine it out f'r deyselves, en
when YOU fine it out en tell um 'bout it, dey doan' b'lieve
you."</p>

<p>Tom give him a dime, and said we wouldn't tell nobody; and told
him to buy some more thread to tie up his wool with; and then looks
at Jim, and says:</p>
<p>"I wonder if Uncle Silas is going to hang this nigger. &nbsp;If
I was to catch a nigger that was ungrateful enough to run away, I
wouldn't give him up, I'd hang him." &nbsp;And whilst the nigger
stepped to the door to look at the dime and bite it to see if it
was good, he whispers to Jim and says:</p>
<p>"Don't ever let on to know us. &nbsp;And if you hear any digging
going on nights, it's us; we're going to set you free."</p>
<p>Jim only had time to grab us by the hand and squeeze it; then
the nigger come back, and we said we'd come again some time if the
nigger wanted us to; and he said he would, more particular if it
was dark, because the witches went for him mostly in the dark, and
it was good to have folks around then.</p>

CHAPTER XXXV.</p>
<p>IT would be most an hour yet till breakfast, so we left and
struck down into the woods; because Tom said we got to have SOME
light to see how to dig by, and a lantern makes too much, and might
get us into trouble; what we must have was a lot of them rotten
chunks that's called fox-fire, and just makes a soft kind of a glow
when you lay them in a dark place. &nbsp;We fetched an armful and
hid it in the weeds, and set down to rest, and Tom says, kind of
dissatisfied:</p>
<p>"Blame it, this whole thing is just as easy and awkward as it
can be. And so it makes it so rotten difficult to get up a
difficult plan. &nbsp;There ain't no watchman to be
drugged&mdash;now there OUGHT to be a watchman. &nbsp;There ain't
even a dog to give a sleeping-mixture to. &nbsp;And there's Jim
chained by one leg, with a ten-foot chain, to the leg of his bed:
&nbsp;why, all you got to do is to lift up the bedstead and slip
off the chain. &nbsp;And Uncle Silas he trusts everybody; sends the
key to the punkin-headed nigger, and don't send nobody to watch the
nigger. &nbsp;Jim could a got out of that window-hole before this,
only there wouldn't be no use trying to travel with a ten-foot
chain on his leg. &nbsp;Why, drat it, Huck, it's the stupidest
arrangement I ever see. You got to invent ALL the difficulties.
&nbsp;Well, we can't help it; we got to do the best we can with the
materials we've got. Anyhow, there's one thing&mdash;there's more
honor in getting him out through a lot of difficulties and dangers,
where there warn't one of them furnished to you by the people who
it was their duty to furnish them, and you had to contrive them all
out of your own head. &nbsp;Now look at just that one thing of the
lantern. &nbsp;When you come down to the cold facts, we simply got
to LET ON that a lantern's resky. &nbsp;Why, we could work with a
torchlight procession if we wanted to, I believe. &nbsp;Now, whilst
I think of it, we got to hunt up something to make a saw out of the
first chance we get."</p>
<p>"What do we want of a saw?"</p>
<p>"What do we WANT of it? &nbsp;Hain't we got to saw the leg of
Jim's bed off, so as to get the chain loose?"</p>
<p>"Why, you just said a body could lift up the bedstead and slip
the chain off."</p>
<p>"Well, if that ain't just like you, Huck Finn. &nbsp;You CAN get
up the infant-schooliest ways of going at a thing. &nbsp;Why,
hain't you ever read any books at all?&mdash;Baron Trenck, nor
Casanova, nor Benvenuto Chelleeny, nor Henri IV., nor none of them
heroes? &nbsp;Who ever heard of getting a prisoner loose in such an
old-maidy way as that? &nbsp;No; the way all the best authorities
does is to saw the bed-leg in two, and leave it just so, and
swallow the sawdust, so it can't be found, and put some dirt and
grease around the sawed place so the very keenest seneskal can't
see no sign of it's being sawed, and thinks the bed-leg is
perfectly sound. Then, the night you're ready, fetch the leg a
kick, down she goes; slip off your chain, and there you are.
&nbsp;Nothing to do but hitch your rope ladder to the battlements,
shin down it, break your leg in the moat&mdash;because a rope
ladder is nineteen foot too short, you know&mdash;and there's your
horses and your trusty vassles, and they scoop you up and fling you
across a saddle, and away you go to your native Langudoc, or
Navarre, or wherever it is. It's gaudy, Huck. &nbsp;I wish there
was a moat to this cabin. If we get time, the night of the escape,
we'll dig one."</p>
<p>I says:</p>
<p>"What do we want of a moat when we're going to snake him out
from under the cabin?"</p>
<p>But he never heard me. &nbsp;He had forgot me and everything
else. &nbsp;He had his chin in his hand, thinking. &nbsp;Pretty
soon he sighs and shakes his head; then sighs again, and says:</p>
<p>"No, it wouldn't do&mdash;there ain't necessity enough for
it."</p>
<p>"For what?" &nbsp;I says.</p>
<p>"Why, to saw Jim's leg off," he says.</p>
<p>"Good land!" &nbsp;I says; "why, there ain't NO necessity for
it. &nbsp;And what would you want to saw his leg off for,
anyway?"</p>
<br />

width="416" /><br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<p>"Well, some of the best authorities has done it. &nbsp;They
couldn't get the chain off, so they just cut their hand off and
shoved. &nbsp;And a leg would be better still. &nbsp;But we got to
let that go. &nbsp;There ain't necessity enough in this case; and,
besides, Jim's a nigger, and wouldn't understand the reasons for
it, and how it's the custom in Europe; so we'll let it go.
&nbsp;But there's one thing&mdash;he can have a rope ladder; we can
tear up our sheets and make him a rope ladder easy enough.
&nbsp;And we can send it to him in a pie; it's mostly done that
way. &nbsp;And I've et worse pies."</p>
<p>"Why, Tom Sawyer, how you talk," I says; "Jim ain't got no use
for a rope ladder."</p>
<p>"He HAS got use for it. &nbsp;How YOU talk, you better say; you
don't know nothing about it. &nbsp;He's GOT to have a rope ladder;
they all do."</p>
<p>"What in the nation can he DO with it?"</p>
<p>"DO with it? &nbsp;He can hide it in his bed, can't he?"
&nbsp;That's what they all do; and HE'S got to, too. &nbsp;Huck,
you don't ever seem to want to do anything that's regular; you want
to be starting something fresh all the time. S'pose he DON'T do
nothing with it? ain't it there in his bed, for a clew, after he's
gone? and don't you reckon they'll want clews? &nbsp;Of course they
will. &nbsp;And you wouldn't leave them any? &nbsp;That would be a
PRETTY howdy-do, WOULDN'T it! &nbsp;I never heard of such a
thing."</p>
<p>"Well," I says, "if it's in the regulations, and he's got to
have it, all right, let him have it; because I don't wish to go
back on no regulations; but there's one thing, Tom Sawyer&mdash;if
we go to tearing up our sheets to make Jim a rope ladder, we're
going to get into trouble with Aunt Sally, just as sure as you're
born. &nbsp;Now, the way I look at it, a hickry-bark ladder don't
cost nothing, and don't waste nothing, and is just as good to load
up a pie with, and hide in a straw tick, as any rag ladder you can
start; and as for Jim, he ain't had no experience, and so he don't
care what kind of a&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Oh, shucks, Huck Finn, if I was as ignorant as you I'd keep
still&mdash;that's what I'D do. &nbsp;Who ever heard of a state
prisoner escaping by a hickry-bark ladder? &nbsp;Why, it's
perfectly ridiculous."</p>
<p>"Well, all right, Tom, fix it your own way; but if you'll take
my advice, you'll let me borrow a sheet off of the
clothesline."</p>
<p>He said that would do. &nbsp;And that gave him another idea, and
he says:</p>
<p>"Borrow a shirt, too."</p>
<p>"What do we want of a shirt, Tom?"</p>
<p>"Want it for Jim to keep a journal on."</p>
<p>"Journal your granny&mdash;JIM can't write."</p>
<p>"S'pose he CAN'T write&mdash;he can make marks on the shirt,
can't he, if we make him a pen out of an old pewter spoon or a
piece of an old iron barrel-hoop?"</p>
<p>"Why, Tom, we can pull a feather out of a goose and make him a
better one; and quicker, too."</p>
<p>"PRISONERS don't have geese running around the donjon-keep to
pull pens out of, you muggins. &nbsp;They ALWAYS make their pens
out of the hardest, toughest, troublesomest piece of old brass
candlestick or something like that they can get their hands on; and
it takes them weeks and weeks and months and months to file it out,
too, because they've got to do it by rubbing it on the wall.
&nbsp;THEY wouldn't use a goose-quill if they had it. It ain't
regular."</p>
<p>"Well, then, what'll we make him the ink out of?"</p>
<p>"Many makes it out of iron-rust and tears; but that's the common
sort and women; the best authorities uses their own blood.
&nbsp;Jim can do that; and when he wants to send any little common
ordinary mysterious message to let the world know where he's
captivated, he can write it on the bottom of a tin plate with a
fork and throw it out of the window. &nbsp;The Iron Mask always
done that, and it's a blame' good way, too."</p>
<p>"Jim ain't got no tin plates. &nbsp;They feed him in a pan."</p>
<p>"That ain't nothing; we can get him some."</p>
<p>"Can't nobody READ his plates."</p>
<p>"That ain't got anything to DO with it, Huck Finn. &nbsp;All
HE'S got to do is to write on the plate and throw it out. &nbsp;You
don't HAVE to be able to read it. Why, half the time you can't read
anything a prisoner writes on a tin plate, or anywhere else."</p>
<p>"Well, then, what's the sense in wasting the plates?"</p>
<p>"Why, blame it all, it ain't the PRISONER'S plates."</p>
<p>"But it's SOMEBODY'S plates, ain't it?"</p>
<p>"Well, spos'n it is? &nbsp;What does the PRISONER care
whose&mdash;"</p>
<p>He broke off there, because we heard the breakfast-horn blowing.
&nbsp;So we cleared out for the house.</p>

<br />
<br />
<p>Along during the morning I borrowed a sheet and a white shirt
off of the clothes-line; and I found an old sack and put them in
it, and we went down and got the fox-fire, and put that in too.
&nbsp;I called it borrowing, because that was what pap always
called it; but Tom said it warn't borrowing, it was stealing.
&nbsp;He said we was representing prisoners; and prisoners don't
care how they get a thing so they get it, and nobody don't blame
them for it, either. &nbsp;It ain't no crime in a prisoner to steal
the thing he needs to get away with, Tom said; it's his right; and
so, as long as we was representing a prisoner, we had a perfect
right to steal anything on this place we had the least use for to
get ourselves out of prison with. &nbsp;He said if we warn't
prisoners it would be a very different thing, and nobody but a
mean, ornery person would steal when he warn't a prisoner. &nbsp;So
we allowed we would steal everything there was that come handy.
&nbsp;And yet he made a mighty fuss, one day, after that, when I
stole a watermelon out of the nigger-patch and eat it; and he made
me go and give the niggers a dime without telling them what it was
for. Tom said that what he meant was, we could steal anything we
NEEDED. Well, I says, I needed the watermelon. &nbsp;But he said I
didn't need it to get out of prison with; there's where the
difference was. &nbsp;He said if I'd a wanted it to hide a knife
in, and smuggle it to Jim to kill the seneskal with, it would a
been all right. &nbsp;So I let it go at that, though I couldn't see
no advantage in my representing a prisoner if I got to set down and
chaw over a lot of gold-leaf distinctions like that every time I
see a chance to hog a watermelon.</p>
<p>Well, as I was saying, we waited that morning till everybody was
settled down to business, and nobody in sight around the yard; then
Tom he carried the sack into the lean-to whilst I stood off a piece
to keep watch. &nbsp;By and by he come out, and we went and set
down on the woodpile to talk. &nbsp;He says:</p>
<p>"Everything's all right now except tools; and that's easy
fixed."</p>
<p>"Tools?" &nbsp;I says.</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>"Tools for what?"</p>
<p>"Why, to dig with. &nbsp;We ain't a-going to GNAW him out, are
we?"</p>
<p>"Ain't them old crippled picks and things in there good enough
to dig a nigger out with?" &nbsp;I says.</p>
<p>He turns on me, looking pitying enough to make a body cry, and
says:</p>
<p>"Huck Finn, did you EVER hear of a prisoner having picks and
shovels, and all the modern conveniences in his wardrobe to dig
himself out with? &nbsp;Now I want to ask you&mdash;if you got any
reasonableness in you at all&mdash;what kind of a show would THAT
give him to be a hero? &nbsp;Why, they might as well lend him the
key and done with it. &nbsp;Picks and shovels&mdash;why, they
wouldn't furnish 'em to a king."</p>
<p>"Well, then," I says, "if we don't want the picks and shovels,
what do we want?"</p>
<p>"A couple of case-knives."</p>
<p>"To dig the foundations out from under that cabin with?"</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>"Confound it, it's foolish, Tom."</p>
<p>"It don't make no difference how foolish it is, it's the RIGHT
way&mdash;and it's the regular way. &nbsp;And there ain't no OTHER
way, that ever I heard of, and I've read all the books that gives
any information about these things. They always dig out with a
case-knife&mdash;and not through dirt, mind you; generly it's
through solid rock. &nbsp;And it takes them weeks and weeks and
weeks, and for ever and ever. &nbsp;Why, look at one of them
prisoners in the bottom dungeon of the Castle Deef, in the harbor
of Marseilles, that dug himself out that way; how long was HE at
it, you reckon?"</p>
<p>"I don't know."</p>
<p>"Well, guess."</p>
<p>"I don't know. &nbsp;A month and a half."</p>
<p>"THIRTY-SEVEN YEAR&mdash;and he come out in China. &nbsp;THAT'S
the kind. &nbsp;I wish the bottom of THIS fortress was solid
rock."</p>
<p>"JIM don't know nobody in China."</p>
<p>"What's THAT got to do with it? &nbsp;Neither did that other
fellow. &nbsp;But you're always a-wandering off on a side issue.
&nbsp;Why can't you stick to the main point?"</p>
<p>"All right&mdash;I don't care where he comes out, so he COMES
out; and Jim don't, either, I reckon. &nbsp;But there's one thing,
anyway&mdash;Jim's too old to be dug out with a case-knife.
&nbsp;He won't last."</p>
<p>"Yes he will LAST, too. &nbsp;You don't reckon it's going to
take thirty-seven years to dig out through a DIRT foundation, do
you?"</p>
<p>"How long will it take, Tom?"</p>
<p>"Well, we can't resk being as long as we ought to, because it
mayn't take very long for Uncle Silas to hear from down there by
New Orleans. &nbsp;He'll hear Jim ain't from there. &nbsp;Then his
next move will be to advertise Jim, or something like that.
&nbsp;So we can't resk being as long digging him out as we ought
to. &nbsp;By rights I reckon we ought to be a couple of years; but
we can't. &nbsp;Things being so uncertain, what I recommend is
this: &nbsp;that we really dig right in, as quick as we can; and
after that, we can LET ON, to ourselves, that we was at it
thirty-seven years. &nbsp;Then we can snatch him out and rush him
away the first time there's an alarm. &nbsp;Yes, I reckon that 'll
be the best way."</p>
<p>"Now, there's SENSE in that," I says. &nbsp;"Letting on don't
cost nothing; letting on ain't no trouble; and if it's any object,
I don't mind letting on we was at it a hundred and fifty year.
&nbsp;It wouldn't strain me none, after I got my hand in. &nbsp;So
I'll mosey along now, and smouch a couple of case-knives."</p>

<p>"Smouch three," he says; "we want one to make a saw out of."</p>
<p>"Tom, if it ain't unregular and irreligious to sejest it," I
says, "there's an old rusty saw-blade around yonder sticking under
the weather-boarding behind the smoke-house."</p>
<p>He looked kind of weary and discouraged-like, and says:</p>
<p>"It ain't no use to try to learn you nothing, Huck. &nbsp;Run
along and smouch the knives&mdash;three of them." &nbsp;So I done
it.</p>

CHAPTER XXXVI.</p>
<p>AS soon as we reckoned everybody was asleep that night we went
down the lightning-rod, and shut ourselves up in the lean-to, and
got out our pile of fox-fire, and went to work. &nbsp;We cleared
everything out of the way, about four or five foot along the middle
of the bottom log. &nbsp;Tom said he was right behind Jim's bed
now, and we'd dig in under it, and when we got through there
couldn't nobody in the cabin ever know there was any hole there,
because Jim's counter-pin hung down most to the ground, and you'd
have to raise it up and look under to see the hole. &nbsp;So we dug
and dug with the case-knives till most midnight; and then we was
dog-tired, and our hands was blistered, and yet you couldn't see
we'd done anything hardly. &nbsp;At last I says:</p>
<p>"This ain't no thirty-seven year job; this is a thirty-eight
year job, Tom Sawyer."</p>
<p>He never said nothing. &nbsp;But he sighed, and pretty soon he
stopped digging, and then for a good little while I knowed that he
was thinking. Then he says:</p>
<p>"It ain't no use, Huck, it ain't a-going to work. &nbsp;If we
was prisoners it would, because then we'd have as many years as we
wanted, and no hurry; and we wouldn't get but a few minutes to dig,
every day, while they was changing watches, and so our hands
wouldn't get blistered, and we could keep it up right along, year
in and year out, and do it right, and the way it ought to be done.
&nbsp;But WE can't fool along; we got to rush; we ain't got no time
to spare. &nbsp;If we was to put in another night this way we'd
have to knock off for a week to let our hands get
well&mdash;couldn't touch a case-knife with them sooner."</p>
<p>"Well, then, what we going to do, Tom?"</p>
<p>"I'll tell you. &nbsp;It ain't right, and it ain't moral, and I
wouldn't like it to get out; but there ain't only just the one way:
&nbsp;we got to dig him out with the picks, and LET ON it's
case-knives."</p>
<p>"NOW you're TALKING!" &nbsp;I says; "your head gets leveler and
leveler all the time, Tom Sawyer," I says. &nbsp;"Picks is the
thing, moral or no moral; and as for me, I don't care shucks for
the morality of it, nohow. &nbsp;When I start in to steal a nigger,
or a watermelon, or a Sunday-school book, I ain't no ways
particular how it's done so it's done. &nbsp;What I want is my
nigger; or what I want is my watermelon; or what I want is my
Sunday- school book; and if a pick's the handiest thing, that's the
thing I'm a- going to dig that nigger or that watermelon or that
Sunday-school book out with; and I don't give a dead rat what the
authorities thinks about it nuther."</p>
<p>"Well," he says, "there's excuse for picks and letting-on in a
case like this; if it warn't so, I wouldn't approve of it, nor I
wouldn't stand by and see the rules broke&mdash;because right is
right, and wrong is wrong, and a body ain't got no business doing
wrong when he ain't ignorant and knows better. &nbsp;It might
answer for YOU to dig Jim out with a pick, WITHOUT any letting on,
because you don't know no better; but it wouldn't for me, because I
do know better. &nbsp;Gimme a case-knife."</p>
<p>He had his own by him, but I handed him mine. &nbsp;He flung it
down, and says:</p>
<p>"Gimme a CASE-KNIFE."</p>
<p>I didn't know just what to do&mdash;but then I thought. &nbsp;I
scratched around amongst the old tools, and got a pickaxe and give
it to him, and he took it and went to work, and never said a
word.</p>
<p>He was always just that particular. &nbsp;Full of principle.</p>
<p>So then I got a shovel, and then we picked and shoveled, turn
about, and made the fur fly. &nbsp;We stuck to it about a half an
hour, which was as long as we could stand up; but we had a good
deal of a hole to show for it. When I got up stairs I looked out at
the window and see Tom doing his level best with the lightning-rod,
but he couldn't come it, his hands was so sore. &nbsp;At last he
says:</p>
<p>"It ain't no use, it can't be done. &nbsp;What you reckon I
better do? &nbsp;Can't you think of no way?"</p>
<p>"Yes," I says, "but I reckon it ain't regular. &nbsp;Come up the
stairs, and let on it's a lightning-rod."</p>
<p>So he done it.</p>
<br />

width="428" /><br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<p>Next day Tom stole a pewter spoon and a brass candlestick in the
house, for to make some pens for Jim out of, and six tallow
candles; and I hung around the nigger cabins and laid for a chance,
and stole three tin plates. &nbsp;Tom says it wasn't enough; but I
said nobody wouldn't ever see the plates that Jim throwed out,
because they'd fall in the dog-fennel and jimpson weeds under the
window-hole&mdash;then we could tote them back and he could use
them over again. &nbsp;So Tom was satisfied. &nbsp;Then he
says:</p>
<p>"Now, the thing to study out is, how to get the things to
Jim."</p>
<p>"Take them in through the hole," I says, "when we get it
done."</p>
<p>He only just looked scornful, and said something about nobody
ever heard of such an idiotic idea, and then he went to studying.
&nbsp;By and by he said he had ciphered out two or three ways, but
there warn't no need to decide on any of them yet. &nbsp;Said we'd
got to post Jim first.</p>
<p>That night we went down the lightning-rod a little after ten,
and took one of the candles along, and listened under the
window-hole, and heard Jim snoring; so we pitched it in, and it
didn't wake him. &nbsp;Then we whirled in with the pick and shovel,
and in about two hours and a half the job was done. &nbsp;We crept
in under Jim's bed and into the cabin, and pawed around and found
the candle and lit it, and stood over Jim awhile, and found him
looking hearty and healthy, and then we woke him up gentle and
gradual. &nbsp;He was so glad to see us he most cried; and called
us honey, and all the pet names he could think of; and was for
having us hunt up a cold-chisel to cut the chain off of his leg
with right away, and clearing out without losing any time.
&nbsp;But Tom he showed him how unregular it would be, and set down
and told him all about our plans, and how we could alter them in a
minute any time there was an alarm; and not to be the least afraid,
because we would see he got away, SURE. &nbsp;So Jim he said it was
all right, and we set there and talked over old times awhile, and
then Tom asked a lot of questions, and when Jim told him Uncle
Silas come in every day or two to pray with him, and Aunt Sally
come in to see if he was comfortable and had plenty to eat, and
both of them was kind as they could be, Tom says:</p>
<p>"NOW I know how to fix it. &nbsp;We'll send you some things by
them."</p>
<p>I said, "Don't do nothing of the kind; it's one of the most
jackass ideas I ever struck;" but he never paid no attention to me;
went right on. &nbsp;It was his way when he'd got his plans
set.</p>
<p>So he told Jim how we'd have to smuggle in the rope-ladder pie
and other large things by Nat, the nigger that fed him, and he must
be on the lookout, and not be surprised, and not let Nat see him
open them; and we would put small things in uncle's coat-pockets
and he must steal them out; and we would tie things to aunt's
apron-strings or put them in her apron-pocket, if we got a chance;
and told him what they would be and what they was for. &nbsp;And
told him how to keep a journal on the shirt with his blood, and all
that. He told him everything. &nbsp;Jim he couldn't see no sense in
the most of it, but he allowed we was white folks and knowed better
than him; so he was satisfied, and said he would do it all just as
Tom said.</p>
<p>Jim had plenty corn-cob pipes and tobacco; so we had a right
down good sociable time; then we crawled out through the hole, and
so home to bed, with hands that looked like they'd been chawed.
&nbsp;Tom was in high spirits. He said it was the best fun he ever
had in his life, and the most intellectural; and said if he only
could see his way to it we would keep it up all the rest of our
lives and leave Jim to our children to get out; for he believed Jim
would come to like it better and better the more he got used to it.
&nbsp;He said that in that way it could be strung out to as much as
eighty year, and would be the best time on record. &nbsp;And he
said it would make us all celebrated that had a hand in it.</p>
<p>In the morning we went out to the woodpile and chopped up the
brass candlestick into handy sizes, and Tom put them and the pewter
spoon in his pocket. &nbsp;Then we went to the nigger cabins, and
while I got Nat's notice off, Tom shoved a piece of candlestick
into the middle of a corn- pone that was in Jim's pan, and we went
along with Nat to see how it would work, and it just worked noble;
when Jim bit into it it most mashed all his teeth out; and there
warn't ever anything could a worked better. Tom said so himself.
Jim he never let on but what it was only just a piece of rock or
something like that that's always getting into bread, you know; but
after that he never bit into nothing but what he jabbed his fork
into it in three or four places first.</p>
<p>And whilst we was a-standing there in the dimmish light, here
comes a couple of the hounds bulging in from under Jim's bed; and
they kept on piling in till there was eleven of them, and there
warn't hardly room in there to get your breath. &nbsp;By jings, we
forgot to fasten that lean-to door! &nbsp;The nigger Nat he only
just hollered "Witches" once, and keeled over on to the floor
amongst the dogs, and begun to groan like he was dying. &nbsp;Tom
jerked the door open and flung out a slab of Jim's meat, and the
dogs went for it, and in two seconds he was out himself and back
again and shut the door, and I knowed he'd fixed the other door
too. Then he went to work on the nigger, coaxing him and petting
him, and asking him if he'd been imagining he saw something again.
&nbsp;He raised up, and blinked his eyes around, and says:</p>
<p>"Mars Sid, you'll say I's a fool, but if I didn't b'lieve I see
most a million dogs, er devils, er some'n, I wisht I may die right
heah in dese tracks. &nbsp;I did, mos' sholy. &nbsp;Mars Sid, I
FELT um&mdash;I FELT um, sah; dey was all over me. &nbsp;Dad fetch
it, I jis' wisht I could git my han's on one er dem witches jis'
wunst&mdash;on'y jis' wunst&mdash;it's all I'd ast. &nbsp;But
mos'ly I wisht dey'd lemme 'lone, I does."</p>
<p>Tom says:</p>
<p>"Well, I tell you what I think. &nbsp;What makes them come here
just at this runaway nigger's breakfast-time? &nbsp;It's because
they're hungry; that's the reason. &nbsp;You make them a witch pie;
that's the thing for YOU to do."</p>

<p>"All right, I'll do it, seeing it's you, and you've been good to
us and showed us the runaway nigger. &nbsp;But you got to be mighty
careful. &nbsp;When we come around, you turn your back; and then
whatever we've put in the pan, don't you let on you see it at all.
&nbsp;And don't you look when Jim unloads the pan&mdash;something
might happen, I don't know what. &nbsp;And above all, don't you

CHAPTER XXXVII.</p>
<p>THAT was all fixed. &nbsp;So then we went away and went to the
rubbage-pile in the back yard, where they keep the old boots, and
rags, and pieces of bottles, and wore-out tin things, and all such
truck, and scratched around and found an old tin washpan, and
stopped up the holes as well as we could, to bake the pie in, and
took it down cellar and stole it full of flour and started for
breakfast, and found a couple of shingle-nails that Tom said would
be handy for a prisoner to scrabble his name and sorrows on the
dungeon walls with, and dropped one of them in Aunt Sally's
apron-pocket which was hanging on a chair, and t'other we stuck in
the band of Uncle Silas's hat, which was on the bureau, because we
heard the children say their pa and ma was going to the runaway
nigger's house this morning, and then went to breakfast, and Tom
dropped the pewter spoon in Uncle Silas's coat-pocket, and Aunt
Sally wasn't come yet, so we had to wait a little while.</p>
<p>And when she come she was hot and red and cross, and couldn't
hardly wait for the blessing; and then she went to sluicing out
coffee with one hand and cracking the handiest child's head with
her thimble with the other, and says:</p>
<p>"I've hunted high and I've hunted low, and it does beat all what
HAS become of your other shirt."</p>
<p>My heart fell down amongst my lungs and livers and things, and a
hard piece of corn-crust started down my throat after it and got
met on the road with a cough, and was shot across the table, and
took one of the children in the eye and curled him up like a
fishing-worm, and let a cry out of him the size of a warwhoop, and
Tom he turned kinder blue around the gills, and it all amounted to
a considerable state of things for about a quarter of a minute or
as much as that, and I would a sold out for half price if there was
a bidder. &nbsp;But after that we was all right again&mdash;it was
the sudden surprise of it that knocked us so kind of cold. Uncle
Silas he says:</p>
<p>"It's most uncommon curious, I can't understand it. &nbsp;I know
perfectly well I took it OFF, because&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Because you hain't got but one ON. &nbsp;Just LISTEN at the
man! &nbsp;I know you took it off, and know it by a better way than
your wool-gethering memory, too, because it was on the clo's-line
yesterday&mdash;I see it there myself. But it's gone, that's the
long and the short of it, and you'll just have to change to a red
flann'l one till I can get time to make a new one. And it 'll be
the third I've made in two years. &nbsp;It just keeps a body on the
jump to keep you in shirts; and whatever you do manage to DO with
'm all is more'n I can make out. &nbsp;A body 'd think you WOULD
learn to take some sort of care of 'em at your time of life."</p>
<p>"I know it, Sally, and I do try all I can. &nbsp;But it oughtn't
to be altogether my fault, because, you know, I don't see them nor
have nothing to do with them except when they're on me; and I don't
believe I've ever lost one of them OFF of me."</p>
<p>"Well, it ain't YOUR fault if you haven't, Silas; you'd a done
it if you could, I reckon. &nbsp;And the shirt ain't all that's
gone, nuther. &nbsp;Ther's a spoon gone; and THAT ain't all.
&nbsp;There was ten, and now ther's only nine. The calf got the
shirt, I reckon, but the calf never took the spoon, THAT'S
certain."</p>
<p>"Why, what else is gone, Sally?"</p>
<p>"Ther's six CANDLES gone&mdash;that's what. &nbsp;The rats could
a got the candles, and I reckon they did; I wonder they don't walk
off with the whole place, the way you're always going to stop their
holes and don't do it; and if they warn't fools they'd sleep in
your hair, Silas&mdash;YOU'D never find it out; but you can't lay
the SPOON on the rats, and that I know."</p>
<p>"Well, Sally, I'm in fault, and I acknowledge it; I've been
remiss; but I won't let to-morrow go by without stopping up them
holes."</p>
<p>"Oh, I wouldn't hurry; next year 'll do. &nbsp;Matilda Angelina
Araminta PHELPS!"</p>
<p>Whack comes the thimble, and the child snatches her claws out of
the sugar-bowl without fooling around any. &nbsp;Just then the
nigger woman steps on to the passage, and says:</p>
<p>"Missus, dey's a sheet gone."</p>

<a name="c37-318" id="c37-318"></a><br />

width="311" /><br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<p>"A SHEET gone! &nbsp;Well, for the land's sake!"</p>
<p>"I'll stop up them holes to-day," says Uncle Silas, looking
sorrowful.</p>
<p>"Oh, DO shet up!&mdash;s'pose the rats took the SHEET?
&nbsp;WHERE'S it gone, Lize?"</p>
<p>"Clah to goodness I hain't no notion, Miss' Sally. &nbsp;She wuz
on de clo'sline yistiddy, but she done gone: &nbsp;she ain' dah no
mo' now."</p>
<p>"I reckon the world IS coming to an end. &nbsp;I NEVER see the
beat of it in all my born days. &nbsp;A shirt, and a sheet, and a
spoon, and six can&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Missus," comes a young yaller wench, "dey's a brass cannelstick
miss'n."</p>
<p>"Cler out from here, you hussy, er I'll take a skillet to
ye!"</p>
<p>Well, she was just a-biling. &nbsp;I begun to lay for a chance;
I reckoned I would sneak out and go for the woods till the weather
moderated. &nbsp;She kept a-raging right along, running her
insurrection all by herself, and everybody else mighty meek and
quiet; and at last Uncle Silas, looking kind of foolish, fishes up
that spoon out of his pocket. &nbsp;She stopped, with her mouth
open and her hands up; and as for me, I wished I was in Jeruslem or
somewheres. But not long, because she says:</p>
<p>"It's JUST as I expected. &nbsp;So you had it in your pocket all
the time; and like as not you've got the other things there, too.
&nbsp;How'd it get there?"</p>
<p>"I reely don't know, Sally," he says, kind of apologizing, "or
you know I would tell. &nbsp;I was a-studying over my text in Acts
Seventeen before breakfast, and I reckon I put it in there, not
noticing, meaning to put my Testament in, and it must be so,
because my Testament ain't in; but I'll go and see; and if the
Testament is where I had it, I'll know I didn't put it in, and that
will show that I laid the Testament down and took up the spoon,
and&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Oh, for the land's sake! &nbsp;Give a body a rest! &nbsp;Go
'long now, the whole kit and biling of ye; and don't come nigh me
again till I've got back my peace of mind."</p>
<p>I'D a heard her if she'd a said it to herself, let alone
speaking it out; and I'd a got up and obeyed her if I'd a been
dead. &nbsp;As we was passing through the setting-room the old man
he took up his hat, and the shingle- nail fell out on the floor,
and he just merely picked it up and laid it on the mantel-shelf,
and never said nothing, and went out. &nbsp;Tom see him do it, and
remembered about the spoon, and says:</p>
<p>"Well, it ain't no use to send things by HIM no more, he ain't
reliable." Then he says: &nbsp;"But he done us a good turn with the
spoon, anyway, without knowing it, and so we'll go and do him one
without HIM knowing it&mdash;stop up his rat-holes."</p>
<p>There was a noble good lot of them down cellar, and it took us a
whole hour, but we done the job tight and good and shipshape.
&nbsp;Then we heard steps on the stairs, and blowed out our light
and hid; and here comes the old man, with a candle in one hand and
a bundle of stuff in t'other, looking as absent-minded as year
before last. &nbsp;He went a mooning around, first to one rat-hole
and then another, till he'd been to them all. &nbsp;Then he stood
about five minutes, picking tallow-drip off of his candle and
thinking. &nbsp;Then he turns off slow and dreamy towards the
stairs, saying:</p>
<p>"Well, for the life of me I can't remember when I done it.
&nbsp;I could show her now that I warn't to blame on account of the
rats. &nbsp;But never mind&mdash;let it go. &nbsp;I reckon it
wouldn't do no good."</p>
<p>And so he went on a-mumbling up stairs, and then we left.
&nbsp;He was a mighty nice old man. &nbsp;And always is.</p>
<p>Tom was a good deal bothered about what to do for a spoon, but
he said we'd got to have it; so he took a think. &nbsp;When he had
ciphered it out he told me how we was to do; then we went and
waited around the spoon-basket till we see Aunt Sally coming, and
then Tom went to counting the spoons and laying them out to one
side, and I slid one of them up my sleeve, and Tom says:</p>
<p>"Why, Aunt Sally, there ain't but nine spoons YET."</p>
<p>She says:</p>
<p>"Go 'long to your play, and don't bother me. &nbsp;I know
better, I counted 'm myself."</p>
<p>"Well, I've counted them twice, Aunty, and I can't make but
nine."</p>
<p>She looked out of all patience, but of course she come to
count&mdash;anybody would.</p>
<p>"I declare to gracious ther' AIN'T but nine!" she says.
&nbsp;"Why, what in the world&mdash;plague TAKE the things, I'll
count 'm again."</p>
<p>So I slipped back the one I had, and when she got done counting,
she says:</p>
<p>"Hang the troublesome rubbage, ther's TEN now!" and she looked
huffy and bothered both. &nbsp;But Tom says:</p>
<p>"Why, Aunty, I don't think there's ten."</p>
<p>"You numskull, didn't you see me COUNT 'm?"</p>
<p>"I know, but&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Well, I'll count 'm AGAIN."</p>
<br />

width="374" /><br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<p>So I smouched one, and they come out nine, same as the other
time. &nbsp;Well, she WAS in a tearing way&mdash;just a-trembling
all over, she was so mad. &nbsp;But she counted and counted till
she got that addled she'd start to count in the basket for a spoon
sometimes; and so, three times they come out right, and three times
they come out wrong. &nbsp;Then she grabbed up the basket and
slammed it across the house and knocked the cat galley-west; and
she said cle'r out and let her have some peace, and if we come
bothering around her again betwixt that and dinner she'd skin us.
&nbsp;So we had the odd spoon, and dropped it in her apron-pocket
whilst she was a- giving us our sailing orders, and Jim got it all
right, along with her shingle nail, before noon. &nbsp;We was very
well satisfied with this business, and Tom allowed it was worth
twice the trouble it took, because he said NOW she couldn't ever
count them spoons twice alike again to save her life; and wouldn't
believe she'd counted them right if she DID; and said that after
she'd about counted her head off for the next three days he judged
she'd give it up and offer to kill anybody that wanted her to ever
count them any more.</p>
<p>So we put the sheet back on the line that night, and stole one
out of her closet; and kept on putting it back and stealing it
again for a couple of days till she didn't know how many sheets she
had any more, and she didn't CARE, and warn't a-going to bullyrag
the rest of her soul out about it, and wouldn't count them again
not to save her life; she druther die first.</p>
<p>So we was all right now, as to the shirt and the sheet and the
spoon and the candles, by the help of the calf and the rats and the
mixed-up counting; and as to the candlestick, it warn't no
consequence, it would blow over by and by.</p>
<p>But that pie was a job; we had no end of trouble with that pie.
&nbsp;We fixed it up away down in the woods, and cooked it there;
and we got it done at last, and very satisfactory, too; but not all
in one day; and we had to use up three wash-pans full of flour
before we got through, and we got burnt pretty much all over, in
places, and eyes put out with the smoke; because, you see, we
didn't want nothing but a crust, and we couldn't prop it up right,
and she would always cave in. &nbsp;But of course we thought of the
right way at last&mdash;which was to cook the ladder, too, in the
pie. &nbsp;So then we laid in with Jim the second night, and tore
up the sheet all in little strings and twisted them together, and
long before daylight we had a lovely rope that you could a hung a
person with. &nbsp;We let on it took nine months to make it.</p>
<p>And in the forenoon we took it down to the woods, but it
wouldn't go into the pie. &nbsp;Being made of a whole sheet, that
way, there was rope enough for forty pies if we'd a wanted them,
and plenty left over for soup, or sausage, or anything you choose.
&nbsp;We could a had a whole dinner.</p>

width="334" /><br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<p>But we didn't need it. &nbsp;All we needed was just enough for
the pie, and so we throwed the rest away. &nbsp;We didn't cook none
of the pies in the wash- pan&mdash;afraid the solder would melt;
but Uncle Silas he had a noble brass warming-pan which he thought
considerable of, because it belonged to one of his ancesters with a
long wooden handle that come over from England with William the
Conqueror in the Mayflower or one of them early ships and was hid
away up garret with a lot of other old pots and things that was
valuable, not on account of being any account, because they warn't,
but on account of them being relicts, you know, and we snaked her
out, private, and took her down there, but she failed on the first
pies, because we didn't know how, but she come up smiling on the
last one. &nbsp;We took and lined her with dough, and set her in
the coals, and loaded her up with rag rope, and put on a dough
roof, and shut down the lid, and put hot embers on top, and stood
off five foot, with the long handle, cool and comfortable, and in
fifteen minutes she turned out a pie that was a satisfaction to
look at. But the person that et it would want to fetch a couple of
kags of toothpicks along, for if that rope ladder wouldn't cramp
him down to business I don't know nothing what I'm talking about,
and lay him in enough stomach-ache to last him till next time,
too.</p>
<p>Nat didn't look when we put the witch pie in Jim's pan; and we
put the three tin plates in the bottom of the pan under the
vittles; and so Jim got everything all right, and as soon as he was
by himself he busted into the pie and hid the rope ladder inside of
his straw tick, and scratched some marks on a tin plate and throwed
it out of the window-hole.</p>

CHAPTER XXXVIII.</p>
<p>MAKING them pens was a distressid tough job, and so was the saw;
and Jim allowed the inscription was going to be the toughest of
all. &nbsp;That's the one which the prisoner has to scrabble on the
wall. &nbsp;But he had to have it; Tom said he'd GOT to; there
warn't no case of a state prisoner not scrabbling his inscription
to leave behind, and his coat of arms.</p>
<p>"Look at Lady Jane Grey," he says; "look at Gilford Dudley; look
at old Northumberland! &nbsp;Why, Huck, s'pose it IS considerble
trouble?&mdash;what you going to do?&mdash;how you going to get
around it? &nbsp;Jim's GOT to do his inscription and coat of arms.
&nbsp;They all do."</p>
<p>Jim says:</p>
<p>"Why, Mars Tom, I hain't got no coat o' arm; I hain't got nuffn
but dish yer ole shirt, en you knows I got to keep de journal on
dat."</p>
<p>"Oh, you don't understand, Jim; a coat of arms is very
different."</p>
<p>"Well," I says, "Jim's right, anyway, when he says he ain't got
no coat of arms, because he hain't."</p>
<p>"I reckon I knowed that," Tom says, "but you bet he'll have one
before he goes out of this&mdash;because he's going out RIGHT, and
there ain't going to be no flaws in his record."</p>
<p>So whilst me and Jim filed away at the pens on a brickbat
apiece, Jim a- making his'n out of the brass and I making mine out
of the spoon, Tom set to work to think out the coat of arms.
&nbsp;By and by he said he'd struck so many good ones he didn't
hardly know which to take, but there was one which he reckoned he'd
decide on. &nbsp;He says:</p>
<p>"On the scutcheon we'll have a bend OR in the dexter base, a
saltire MURREY in the fess, with a dog, couchant, for common
charge, and under his foot a chain embattled, for slavery, with a
chevron VERT in a chief engrailed, and three invected lines on a
field AZURE, with the nombril points rampant on a dancette
indented; crest, a runaway nigger, SABLE, with his bundle over his
shoulder on a bar sinister; and a couple of gules for supporters,
which is you and me; motto, MAGGIORE FRETTA, MINORE OTTO. &nbsp;Got
it out of a book&mdash;means the more haste the less speed."</p>
<p>"Geewhillikins," I says, "but what does the rest of it
mean?"</p>
<p>"We ain't got no time to bother over that," he says; "we got to
dig in like all git-out."</p>
<p>"Well, anyway," I says, "what's SOME of it? &nbsp;What's a
fess?"</p>
<p>"A fess&mdash;a fess is&mdash;YOU don't need to know what a fess
is. &nbsp;I'll show him how to make it when he gets to it."</p>
<p>"Shucks, Tom," I says, "I think you might tell a person.
&nbsp;What's a bar sinister?"</p>
<p>"Oh, I don't know. &nbsp;But he's got to have it. &nbsp;All the
nobility does."</p>
<p>That was just his way. &nbsp;If it didn't suit him to explain a
thing to you, he wouldn't do it. &nbsp;You might pump at him a
week, it wouldn't make no difference.</p>
<p>He'd got all that coat of arms business fixed, so now he started
in to finish up the rest of that part of the work, which was to
plan out a mournful inscription&mdash;said Jim got to have one,
like they all done. &nbsp;He made up a lot, and wrote them out on a
paper, and read them off, so:</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;Here a captive heart busted. 2. &nbsp;Here a poor
prisoner, forsook by the world and friends, fretted his sorrowful
life. 3. &nbsp;Here a lonely heart broke, and a worn spirit went to
its rest, after thirty-seven years of solitary captivity. 4.
&nbsp;Here, homeless and friendless, after thirty-seven years of
bitter captivity, perished a noble stranger, natural son of Louis
XIV.</p>
<p>Tom's voice trembled whilst he was reading them, and he most
broke down. When he got done he couldn't no way make up his mind
which one for Jim to scrabble on to the wall, they was all so good;
but at last he allowed he would let him scrabble them all on.
&nbsp;Jim said it would take him a year to scrabble such a lot of
truck on to the logs with a nail, and he didn't know how to make
letters, besides; but Tom said he would block them out for him, and
then he wouldn't have nothing to do but just follow the lines.
&nbsp;Then pretty soon he says:</p>
<p>"Come to think, the logs ain't a-going to do; they don't have
log walls in a dungeon: &nbsp;we got to dig the inscriptions into a
rock. &nbsp;We'll fetch a rock."</p>
<p>Jim said the rock was worse than the logs; he said it would take
him such a pison long time to dig them into a rock he wouldn't ever
get out. &nbsp;But Tom said he would let me help him do it.
&nbsp;Then he took a look to see how me and Jim was getting along
with the pens. &nbsp;It was most pesky tedious hard work and slow,
and didn't give my hands no show to get well of the sores, and we
didn't seem to make no headway, hardly; so Tom says:</p>
<p>"I know how to fix it. &nbsp;We got to have a rock for the coat
of arms and mournful inscriptions, and we can kill two birds with
that same rock. There's a gaudy big grindstone down at the mill,
and we'll smouch it, and carve the things on it, and file out the
pens and the saw on it, too."</p>
<br />

<img alt="c38-327.jpg (73K)" src="images/c38-327.jpg" height="529"
width="586" /><br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<p>It warn't no slouch of an idea; and it warn't no slouch of a
grindstone nuther; but we allowed we'd tackle it. &nbsp;It warn't
quite midnight yet, so we cleared out for the mill, leaving Jim at
work. &nbsp;We smouched the grindstone, and set out to roll her
home, but it was a most nation tough job. Sometimes, do what we
could, we couldn't keep her from falling over, and she come mighty
near mashing us every time. &nbsp;Tom said she was going to get one
of us, sure, before we got through. &nbsp;We got her half way; and
then we was plumb played out, and most drownded with sweat.
&nbsp;We see it warn't no use; we got to go and fetch Jim. So he
raised up his bed and slid the chain off of the bed-leg, and wrapt
it round and round his neck, and we crawled out through our hole
and down there, and Jim and me laid into that grindstone and walked
her along like nothing; and Tom superintended. &nbsp;He could
out-superintend any boy I ever see. &nbsp;He knowed how to do
everything.</p>
<p>Our hole was pretty big, but it warn't big enough to get the
grindstone through; but Jim he took the pick and soon made it big
enough. &nbsp;Then Tom marked out them things on it with the nail,
and set Jim to work on them, with the nail for a chisel and an iron
bolt from the rubbage in the lean- to for a hammer, and told him to
work till the rest of his candle quit on him, and then he could go
to bed, and hide the grindstone under his straw tick and sleep on
it. &nbsp;Then we helped him fix his chain back on the bed-leg, and
was ready for bed ourselves. &nbsp;But Tom thought of something,
and says:</p>
<p>"You got any spiders in here, Jim?"</p>
<p>"No, sah, thanks to goodness I hain't, Mars Tom."</p>
<p>"All right, we'll get you some."</p>
<p>"But bless you, honey, I doan' WANT none. &nbsp;I's afeard un
um. &nbsp;I jis' 's soon have rattlesnakes aroun'."</p>
<p>Tom thought a minute or two, and says:</p>
<p>"It's a good idea. &nbsp;And I reckon it's been done. &nbsp;It
MUST a been done; it stands to reason. &nbsp;Yes, it's a prime good
idea. &nbsp;Where could you keep it?"</p>
<p>"Keep what, Mars Tom?"</p>
<p>"Why, a rattlesnake."</p>
<p>"De goodness gracious alive, Mars Tom! &nbsp;Why, if dey was a
rattlesnake to come in heah I'd take en bust right out thoo dat log
wall, I would, wid my head."</p>
<p>"Why, Jim, you wouldn't be afraid of it after a little.
&nbsp;You could tame it."</p>
<p>"TAME it!"</p>
<p>"Yes&mdash;easy enough. &nbsp;Every animal is grateful for
kindness and petting, and they wouldn't THINK of hurting a person
that pets them. &nbsp;Any book will tell you that. &nbsp;You
try&mdash;that's all I ask; just try for two or three days. Why,
you can get him so, in a little while, that he'll love you; and
sleep with you; and won't stay away from you a minute; and will let
you wrap him round your neck and put his head in your mouth."</p>
<p>"PLEASE, Mars Tom&mdash;DOAN' talk so! &nbsp;I can't STAN' it!
&nbsp;He'd LET me shove his head in my mouf&mdash;fer a favor,
hain't it? &nbsp;I lay he'd wait a pow'ful long time 'fo' I AST
him. &nbsp;En mo' en dat, I doan' WANT him to sleep wid me."</p>
<p>"Jim, don't act so foolish. &nbsp;A prisoner's GOT to have some
kind of a dumb pet, and if a rattlesnake hain't ever been tried,
why, there's more glory to be gained in your being the first to
ever try it than any other way you could ever think of to save your
life."</p>
<p>"Why, Mars Tom, I doan' WANT no sich glory. &nbsp;Snake take 'n
bite Jim's chin off, den WHAH is de glory? &nbsp;No, sah, I doan'
want no sich doin's."</p>
<p>"Blame it, can't you TRY? &nbsp;I only WANT you to try&mdash;you
needn't keep it up if it don't work."</p>
<p>"But de trouble all DONE ef de snake bite me while I's a tryin'
him. Mars Tom, I's willin' to tackle mos' anything 'at ain't
onreasonable, but ef you en Huck fetches a rattlesnake in heah for
me to tame, I's gwyne to LEAVE, dat's SHORE."</p>
<p>"Well, then, let it go, let it go, if you're so bull-headed
about it. &nbsp;We can get you some garter-snakes, and you can tie
some buttons on their tails, and let on they're rattlesnakes, and I
reckon that 'll have to do."</p>

<br />
<p>"I k'n stan' DEM, Mars Tom, but blame' 'f I couldn' get along
widout um, I tell you dat. &nbsp;I never knowed b'fo' 't was so
much bother and trouble to be a prisoner."</p>
<p>"Well, it ALWAYS is when it's done right. &nbsp;You got any rats
around here?"</p>
<p>"No, sah, I hain't seed none."</p>
<p>"Well, we'll get you some rats."</p>
<p>"Why, Mars Tom, I doan' WANT no rats. &nbsp;Dey's de
dadblamedest creturs to 'sturb a body, en rustle roun' over 'im, en
bite his feet, when he's tryin' to sleep, I ever see. &nbsp;No,
sah, gimme g'yarter-snakes, 'f I's got to have 'm, but doan' gimme
no rats; I hain' got no use f'r um, skasely."</p>
<p>"But, Jim, you GOT to have 'em&mdash;they all do. &nbsp;So don't
make no more fuss about it. &nbsp;Prisoners ain't ever without
rats. &nbsp;There ain't no instance of it. &nbsp;And they train
them, and pet them, and learn them tricks, and they get to be as
sociable as flies. &nbsp;But you got to play music to them.
&nbsp;You got anything to play music on?"</p>
<p>"I ain' got nuffn but a coase comb en a piece o' paper, en a
juice-harp; but I reck'n dey wouldn' take no stock in a
juice-harp."</p>
<p>"Yes they would. &nbsp;THEY don't care what kind of music 'tis.
&nbsp;A jews-harp's plenty good enough for a rat. &nbsp;All animals
like music&mdash;in a prison they dote on it. &nbsp;Specially,
painful music; and you can't get no other kind out of a jews-harp.
&nbsp;It always interests them; they come out to see what's the
matter with you. &nbsp;Yes, you're all right; you're fixed very
well. &nbsp;You want to set on your bed nights before you go to
sleep, and early in the mornings, and play your jews-harp; play
'The Last Link is Broken'&mdash;that's the thing that 'll scoop a
rat quicker 'n anything else; and when you've played about two
minutes you'll see all the rats, and the snakes, and spiders, and
things begin to feel worried about you, and come. &nbsp;And they'll
just fairly swarm over you, and have a noble good time."</p>
<p>"Yes, DEY will, I reck'n, Mars Tom, but what kine er time is JIM
havin'? Blest if I kin see de pint. &nbsp;But I'll do it ef I got
to. &nbsp;I reck'n I better keep de animals satisfied, en not have
no trouble in de house."</p>
<p>Tom waited to think it over, and see if there wasn't nothing
else; and pretty soon he says:</p>
<p>"Oh, there's one thing I forgot. &nbsp;Could you raise a flower
here, do you reckon?"</p>
<p>"I doan know but maybe I could, Mars Tom; but it's tolable dark
in heah, en I ain' got no use f'r no flower, nohow, en she'd be a
pow'ful sight o' trouble."</p>
<p>"Well, you try it, anyway. &nbsp;Some other prisoners has done
it."</p>
<p>"One er dem big cat-tail-lookin' mullen-stalks would grow in
heah, Mars Tom, I reck'n, but she wouldn't be wuth half de trouble
she'd coss."</p>
<p>"Don't you believe it. &nbsp;We'll fetch you a little one and
you plant it in the corner over there, and raise it. &nbsp;And
don't call it mullen, call it Pitchiola&mdash;that's its right name
when it's in a prison. &nbsp;And you want to water it with your
tears."</p>
<p>"Why, I got plenty spring water, Mars Tom."</p>
<p>"You don't WANT spring water; you want to water it with your
tears. &nbsp;It's the way they always do."</p>
<p>"Why, Mars Tom, I lay I kin raise one er dem mullen-stalks
twyste wid spring water whiles another man's a START'N one wid
tears."</p>

<p>"That ain't the idea. &nbsp;You GOT to do it with tears."</p>
<p>"She'll die on my han's, Mars Tom, she sholy will; kase I doan'
skasely ever cry."</p>
<p>So Tom was stumped. &nbsp;But he studied it over, and then said
Jim would have to worry along the best he could with an onion.
&nbsp;He promised he would go to the nigger cabins and drop one,
private, in Jim's coffee-pot, in the morning. Jim said he would
"jis' 's soon have tobacker in his coffee;" and found so much fault
with it, and with the work and bother of raising the mullen, and
jews-harping the rats, and petting and flattering up the snakes and
spiders and things, on top of all the other work he had to do on
pens, and inscriptions, and journals, and things, which made it
more trouble and worry and responsibility to be a prisoner than
anything he ever undertook, that Tom most lost all patience with
him; and said he was just loadened down with more gaudier chances
than a prisoner ever had in the world to make a name for himself,
and yet he didn't know enough to appreciate them, and they was just
about wasted on him. &nbsp;So Jim he was sorry, and said he
wouldn't behave so no more, and then me and Tom shoved for bed.</p>

CHAPTER XXXIX.</p>
<p>IN the morning we went up to the village and bought a wire
rat-trap and fetched it down, and unstopped the best rat-hole, and
in about an hour we had fifteen of the bulliest kind of ones; and
then we took it and put it in a safe place under Aunt Sally's bed.
&nbsp;But while we was gone for spiders little Thomas Franklin
Benjamin Jefferson Elexander Phelps found it there, and opened the
door of it to see if the rats would come out, and they did; and
Aunt Sally she come in, and when we got back she was a-standing on
top of the bed raising Cain, and the rats was doing what they could
to keep off the dull times for her. &nbsp;So she took and dusted us
both with the hickry, and we was as much as two hours catching
another fifteen or sixteen, drat that meddlesome cub, and they
warn't the likeliest, nuther, because the first haul was the pick
of the flock. &nbsp;I never see a likelier lot of rats than what
that first haul was.</p>
<p>We got a splendid stock of sorted spiders, and bugs, and frogs,
and caterpillars, and one thing or another; and we like to got a
hornet's nest, but we didn't. &nbsp;The family was at home.
&nbsp;We didn't give it right up, but stayed with them as long as
we could; because we allowed we'd tire them out or they'd got to
tire us out, and they done it. &nbsp;Then we got allycumpain and
rubbed on the places, and was pretty near all right again, but
couldn't set down convenient. &nbsp;And so we went for the snakes,
and grabbed a couple of dozen garters and house-snakes, and put
them in a bag, and put it in our room, and by that time it was
supper-time, and a rattling good honest day's work: &nbsp;and
hungry?&mdash;oh, no, I reckon not! &nbsp;And there warn't a
blessed snake up there when we went back&mdash;we didn't half tie
the sack, and they worked out somehow, and left. &nbsp;But it
didn't matter much, because they was still on the premises
somewheres. &nbsp;So we judged we could get some of them again.
&nbsp;No, there warn't no real scarcity of snakes about the house
for a considerable spell. &nbsp;You'd see them dripping from the
rafters and places every now and then; and they generly landed in
your plate, or down the back of your neck, and most of the time
where you didn't want them. &nbsp;Well, they was handsome and
striped, and there warn't no harm in a million of them; but that
never made no difference to Aunt Sally; she despised snakes, be the
breed what they might, and she couldn't stand them no way you could
fix it; and every time one of them flopped down on her, it didn't
make no difference what she was doing, she would just lay that work
down and light out. &nbsp;I never see such a woman. &nbsp;And you
could hear her whoop to Jericho. &nbsp;You couldn't get her to take
a-holt of one of them with the tongs. &nbsp;And if she turned over
and found one in bed she would scramble out and lift a howl that
you would think the house was afire. &nbsp;She disturbed the old
man so that he said he could most wish there hadn't ever been no
snakes created. &nbsp;Why, after every last snake had been gone
clear out of the house for as much as a week Aunt Sally warn't over
it yet; she warn't near over it; when she was setting thinking
about something you could touch her on the back of her neck with a
feather and she would jump right out of her stockings. &nbsp;It was
very curious. &nbsp;But Tom said all women was just so. &nbsp;He
said they was made that way for some reason or other.</p>
<p>We got a licking every time one of our snakes come in her way,
and she allowed these lickings warn't nothing to what she would do
if we ever loaded up the place again with them. &nbsp;I didn't mind
the lickings, because they didn't amount to nothing; but I minded
the trouble we had to lay in another lot. &nbsp;But we got them
laid in, and all the other things; and you never see a cabin as
blithesome as Jim's was when they'd all swarm out for music and go
for him. &nbsp;Jim didn't like the spiders, and the spiders didn't
like Jim; and so they'd lay for him, and make it mighty warm for
him. &nbsp;And he said that between the rats and the snakes and the
grindstone there warn't no room in bed for him, skasely; and when
there was, a body couldn't sleep, it was so lively, and it was
always lively, he said, because THEY never all slept at one time,
but took turn about, so when the snakes was asleep the rats was on
deck, and when the rats turned in the snakes come on watch, so he
always had one gang under him, in his way, and t'other gang having
a circus over him, and if he got up to hunt a new place the spiders
would take a chance at him as he crossed over. He said if he ever
got out this time he wouldn't ever be a prisoner again, not for a
salary.</p>
<p>Well, by the end of three weeks everything was in pretty good
shape. &nbsp;The shirt was sent in early, in a pie, and every time
a rat bit Jim he would get up and write a little in his journal
whilst the ink was fresh; the pens was made, the inscriptions and
so on was all carved on the grindstone; the bed-leg was sawed in
two, and we had et up the sawdust, and it give us a most amazing
stomach-ache. &nbsp;We reckoned we was all going to die, but
didn't. &nbsp;It was the most undigestible sawdust I ever see; and
Tom said the same./</p>

<br />
<br />
<br /></p>
<p>But as I was saying, we'd got all the work done now, at last;
and we was all pretty much fagged out, too, but mainly Jim.
&nbsp;The old man had wrote a couple of times to the plantation
below Orleans to come and get their runaway nigger, but hadn't got
no answer, because there warn't no such plantation; so he allowed
he would advertise Jim in the St. Louis and New Orleans papers; and
when he mentioned the St. Louis ones it give me the cold shivers,
and I see we hadn't no time to lose. So Tom said, now for the
nonnamous letters.</p>
<p>"What's them?" &nbsp;I says.</p>
<p>"Warnings to the people that something is up. &nbsp;Sometimes
it's done one way, sometimes another. &nbsp;But there's always
somebody spying around that gives notice to the governor of the
castle. &nbsp;When Louis XVI. was going to light out of the
Tooleries, a servant-girl done it. &nbsp;It's a very good way, and
so is the nonnamous letters. &nbsp;We'll use them both. &nbsp;And
it's usual for the prisoner's mother to change clothes with him,
and she stays in, and he slides out in her clothes. &nbsp;We'll do
that, too."</p>
<p>"But looky here, Tom, what do we want to WARN anybody for that
something's up? &nbsp;Let them find it out for
themselves&mdash;it's their lookout."</p>
<p>"Yes, I know; but you can't depend on them. &nbsp;It's the way
they've acted from the very start&mdash;left us to do EVERYTHING.
&nbsp;They're so confiding and mullet-headed they don't take notice
of nothing at all. &nbsp;So if we don't GIVE them notice there
won't be nobody nor nothing to interfere with us, and so after all
our hard work and trouble this escape 'll go off perfectly flat;
won't amount to nothing&mdash;won't be nothing TO it."</p>
<p>"Well, as for me, Tom, that's the way I'd like."</p>
<p>"Shucks!" he says, and looked disgusted. &nbsp;So I says:</p>
<p>"But I ain't going to make no complaint. &nbsp;Any way that
suits you suits me. What you going to do about the
servant-girl?"</p>
<p>"You'll be her. &nbsp;You slide in, in the middle of the night,
and hook that yaller girl's frock."</p>
<p>"Why, Tom, that 'll make trouble next morning; because, of
course, she prob'bly hain't got any but that one."</p>
<p>"I know; but you don't want it but fifteen minutes, to carry the
nonnamous letter and shove it under the front door."</p>
<p>"All right, then, I'll do it; but I could carry it just as handy
in my own togs."</p>
<p>"You wouldn't look like a servant-girl THEN, would you?"</p>
<p>"No, but there won't be nobody to see what I look like,
ANYWAY."</p>
<p>"That ain't got nothing to do with it. &nbsp;The thing for us to
do is just to do our DUTY, and not worry about whether anybody SEES
us do it or not. Hain't you got no principle at all?"</p>
<p>"All right, I ain't saying nothing; I'm the servant-girl.
&nbsp;Who's Jim's mother?"</p>
<p>"I'm his mother. &nbsp;I'll hook a gown from Aunt Sally."</p>
<p>"Well, then, you'll have to stay in the cabin when me and Jim
leaves."</p>
<p>"Not much. &nbsp;I'll stuff Jim's clothes full of straw and lay
it on his bed to represent his mother in disguise, and Jim 'll take
the nigger woman's gown off of me and wear it, and we'll all evade
together. &nbsp;When a prisoner of style escapes it's called an
evasion. &nbsp;It's always called so when a king escapes,
f'rinstance. &nbsp;And the same with a king's son; it don't make no
difference whether he's a natural one or an unnatural one."</p>
<p>So Tom he wrote the nonnamous letter, and I smouched the yaller
wench's frock that night, and put it on, and shoved it under the
front door, the way Tom told me to. &nbsp;It said:</p>
<p>Beware. &nbsp;Trouble is brewing. &nbsp;Keep a sharp lookout.

<br />
<p>Next night we stuck a picture, which Tom drawed in blood, of a
skull and crossbones on the front door; and next night another one
of a coffin on the back door. &nbsp;I never see a family in such a
sweat. &nbsp;They couldn't a been worse scared if the place had a
been full of ghosts laying for them behind everything and under the
beds and shivering through the air. &nbsp;If a door banged, Aunt
Sally she jumped and said "ouch!" if anything fell, she jumped and
said "ouch!" if you happened to touch her, when she warn't
noticing, she done the same; she couldn't face noway and be
satisfied, because she allowed there was something behind her every
time&mdash;so she was always a-whirling around sudden, and saying
"ouch," and before she'd got two-thirds around she'd whirl back
again, and say it again; and she was afraid to go to bed, but she
dasn't set up. &nbsp;So the thing was working very well, Tom said;
he said he never see a thing work more satisfactory. He said it
showed it was done right.</p>
<p>So he said, now for the grand bulge! &nbsp;So the very next
morning at the streak of dawn we got another letter ready, and was
wondering what we better do with it, because we heard them say at
supper they was going to have a nigger on watch at both doors all
night. &nbsp;Tom he went down the lightning-rod to spy around; and
the nigger at the back door was asleep, and he stuck it in the back
of his neck and come back. &nbsp;This letter said:</p>
<p>Don't betray me, I wish to be your friend. &nbsp;There is a
desprate gang of cutthroats from over in the Indian Territory going
to steal your runaway nigger to-night, and they have been trying to
scare you so as you will stay in the house and not bother them.
&nbsp;I am one of the gang, but have got religgion and wish to quit
it and lead an honest life again, and will betray the helish
design. They will sneak down from northards, along the fence, at
midnight exact, with a false key, and go in the nigger's cabin to
get him. I am to be off a piece and blow a tin horn if I see any
danger; but stead of that I will BA like a sheep soon as they get
in and not blow at all; then whilst they are getting his chains
loose, you slip there and lock them in, and can kill them at your
leasure. &nbsp;Don't do anything but just the way I am telling you,
if you do they will suspicion something and raise
whoop-jamboreehoo. I do not wish any reward but to know I have done
the right thing. UNKNOWN FRIEND.</p>

CHAPTER XL.</p>
<p>WE was feeling pretty good after breakfast, and took my canoe
and went over the river a-fishing, with a lunch, and had a good
time, and took a look at the raft and found her all right, and got
home late to supper, and found them in such a sweat and worry they
didn't know which end they was standing on, and made us go right
off to bed the minute we was done supper, and wouldn't tell us what
the trouble was, and never let on a word about the new letter, but
didn't need to, because we knowed as much about it as anybody did,
and as soon as we was half up stairs and her back was turned we
slid for the cellar cupboard and loaded up a good lunch and took it
up to our room and went to bed, and got up about half- past eleven,
and Tom put on Aunt Sally's dress that he stole and was going to
start with the lunch, but says:</p>
<p>"Where's the butter?"</p>
<p>"I laid out a hunk of it," I says, "on a piece of a
corn-pone."</p>
<p>"Well, you LEFT it laid out, then&mdash;it ain't here."</p>
<p>"We can get along without it," I says.</p>
<p>"We can get along WITH it, too," he says; "just you slide down
cellar and fetch it. &nbsp;And then mosey right down the
lightning-rod and come along. I'll go and stuff the straw into
Jim's clothes to represent his mother in disguise, and be ready to
BA like a sheep and shove soon as you get there."</p>
<p>So out he went, and down cellar went I. The hunk of butter, big
as a person's fist, was where I had left it, so I took up the slab
of corn- pone with it on, and blowed out my light, and started up
stairs very stealthy, and got up to the main floor all right, but
here comes Aunt Sally with a candle, and I clapped the truck in my
hat, and clapped my hat on my head, and the next second she see me;
and she says:</p>
<p>"You been down cellar?"</p>
<p>"Yes'm."</p>
<p>"What you been doing down there?"</p>
<p>"Noth'n."</p>
<p>"NOTH'N!"</p>
<p>"No'm."</p>
<p>"Well, then, what possessed you to go down there this time of
night?"</p>
<p>"I don't know 'm."</p>
<p>"You don't KNOW? &nbsp;Don't answer me that way. Tom, I want to
know what you been DOING down there."</p>
<p>"I hain't been doing a single thing, Aunt Sally, I hope to
gracious if I have."</p>
<p>I reckoned she'd let me go now, and as a generl thing she would;
but I s'pose there was so many strange things going on she was just
in a sweat about every little thing that warn't yard-stick
straight; so she says, very decided:</p>
<p>"You just march into that setting-room and stay there till I
come. &nbsp;You been up to something you no business to, and I lay
I'll find out what it is before I'M done with you."</p>
<p>So she went away as I opened the door and walked into the
setting-room. My, but there was a crowd there! &nbsp;Fifteen
farmers, and every one of them had a gun. &nbsp;I was most powerful
sick, and slunk to a chair and set down. They was setting around,
some of them talking a little, in a low voice, and all of them
fidgety and uneasy, but trying to look like they warn't; but I
knowed they was, because they was always taking off their hats, and
putting them on, and scratching their heads, and changing their
seats, and fumbling with their buttons. &nbsp;I warn't easy myself,
but I didn't take my hat off, all the same.</p>
<br />

<br />
<a name="c40-341" id="c40-341"></a><br />

<img alt="c40-341.jpg (59K)" src="images/c40-341.jpg" height="444"
width="536" /><br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<p>I did wish Aunt Sally would come, and get done with me, and lick
me, if she wanted to, and let me get away and tell Tom how we'd
overdone this thing, and what a thundering hornet's-nest we'd got
ourselves into, so we could stop fooling around straight off, and
clear out with Jim before these rips got out of patience and come
for us.</p>
<p>At last she come and begun to ask me questions, but I COULDN'T
answer them straight, I didn't know which end of me was up; because
these men was in such a fidget now that some was wanting to start
right NOW and lay for them desperadoes, and saying it warn't but a
few minutes to midnight; and others was trying to get them to hold
on and wait for the sheep- signal; and here was Aunty pegging away
at the questions, and me a- shaking all over and ready to sink down
in my tracks I was that scared; and the place getting hotter and
hotter, and the butter beginning to melt and run down my neck and
behind my ears; and pretty soon, when one of them says, "I'M for
going and getting in the cabin FIRST and right NOW, and catching
them when they come," I most dropped; and a streak of butter come
a-trickling down my forehead, and Aunt Sally she see it, and turns
white as a sheet, and says:</p>
<p>"For the land's sake, what IS the matter with the child?
&nbsp;He's got the brain-fever as shore as you're born, and they're
oozing out!"</p>
<p>And everybody runs to see, and she snatches off my hat, and out
comes the bread and what was left of the butter, and she grabbed
me, and hugged me, and says:</p>
<p>"Oh, what a turn you did give me! and how glad and grateful I am
it ain't no worse; for luck's against us, and it never rains but it
pours, and when I see that truck I thought we'd lost you, for I
knowed by the color and all it was just like your brains would be
if&mdash;Dear, dear, whyd'nt you TELL me that was what you'd been
down there for, I wouldn't a cared. &nbsp;Now cler out to bed, and
don't lemme see no more of you till morning!"</p>
<p>I was up stairs in a second, and down the lightning-rod in
another one, and shinning through the dark for the lean-to. &nbsp;I
couldn't hardly get my words out, I was so anxious; but I told Tom
as quick as I could we must jump for it now, and not a minute to
lose&mdash;the house full of men, yonder, with guns!</p>
<p>His eyes just blazed; and he says:</p>
<p>"No!&mdash;is that so? &nbsp;AIN'T it bully! &nbsp;Why, Huck, if
it was to do over again, I bet I could fetch two hundred! &nbsp;If
we could put it off till&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Hurry! &nbsp;HURRY!" &nbsp;I says. &nbsp;"Where's Jim?"</p>
<p>"Right at your elbow; if you reach out your arm you can touch
him. &nbsp;He's dressed, and everything's ready. &nbsp;Now we'll
slide out and give the sheep- signal."</p>
<p>But then we heard the tramp of men coming to the door, and heard
them begin to fumble with the pad-lock, and heard a man say:</p>
<p>"I TOLD you we'd be too soon; they haven't come&mdash;the door
is locked. Here, I'll lock some of you into the cabin, and you lay
for 'em in the dark and kill 'em when they come; and the rest
scatter around a piece, and listen if you can hear 'em coming."</p>
<p>So in they come, but couldn't see us in the dark, and most trod
on us whilst we was hustling to get under the bed. &nbsp;But we got
under all right, and out through the hole, swift but soft&mdash;Jim
first, me next, and Tom last, which was according to Tom's orders.
&nbsp;Now we was in the lean-to, and heard trampings close by
outside. &nbsp;So we crept to the door, and Tom stopped us there
and put his eye to the crack, but couldn't make out nothing, it was
so dark; and whispered and said he would listen for the steps to
get further, and when he nudged us Jim must glide out first, and
him last. &nbsp;So he set his ear to the crack and listened, and
listened, and listened, and the steps a-scraping around out there
all the time; and at last he nudged us, and we slid out, and
stooped down, not breathing, and not making the least noise, and
slipped stealthy towards the fence in Injun file, and got to it all
right, and me and Jim over it; but Tom's britches catched fast on a
splinter on the top rail, and then he hear the steps coming, so he
had to pull loose, which snapped the splinter and made a noise; and
as he dropped in our tracks and started somebody sings out:</p>
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<a name="c40-343" id="c40-343"></a><br />
<br />
<img alt="c40-343.jpg (76K)" src="images/c40-343.jpg" height="563"
width="377" /><br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<p>"Who's that? &nbsp;Answer, or I'll shoot!"</p>
<p>But we didn't answer; we just unfurled our heels and shoved.
&nbsp;Then there was a rush, and a BANG, BANG, BANG! and the
bullets fairly whizzed around us! We heard them sing out:</p>
<p>"Here they are! &nbsp;They've broke for the river! &nbsp;After
'em, boys, and turn loose the dogs!"</p>
<p>So here they come, full tilt. &nbsp;We could hear them because
they wore boots and yelled, but we didn't wear no boots and didn't
yell. &nbsp;We was in the path to the mill; and when they got
pretty close on to us we dodged into the bush and let them go by,
and then dropped in behind them. &nbsp;They'd had all the dogs shut
up, so they wouldn't scare off the robbers; but by this time
somebody had let them loose, and here they come, making powwow
enough for a million; but they was our dogs; so we stopped in our
tracks till they catched up; and when they see it warn't nobody but
us, and no excitement to offer them, they only just said howdy, and
tore right ahead towards the shouting and clattering; and then we
up-steam again, and whizzed along after them till we was nearly to
the mill, and then struck up through the bush to where my canoe was
tied, and hopped in and pulled for dear life towards the middle of
the river, but didn't make no more noise than we was obleeged to.
Then we struck out, easy and comfortable, for the island where my
raft was; and we could hear them yelling and barking at each other
all up and down the bank, till we was so far away the sounds got
dim and died out. &nbsp;And when we stepped on to the raft I
says:</p>
<p>"NOW, old Jim, you're a free man again, and I bet you won't ever
be a slave no more."</p>
<p>"En a mighty good job it wuz, too, Huck. &nbsp;It 'uz planned
beautiful, en it 'uz done beautiful; en dey ain't NOBODY kin git up
a plan dat's mo' mixed-up en splendid den what dat one wuz."</p>
<p>We was all glad as we could be, but Tom was the gladdest of all
because he had a bullet in the calf of his leg.</p>
<p>When me and Jim heard that we didn't feel so brash as what we
did before. It was hurting him considerable, and bleeding; so we
laid him in the wigwam and tore up one of the duke's shirts for to
bandage him, but he says:</p>
<p>"Gimme the rags; I can do it myself. &nbsp;Don't stop now; don't
fool around here, and the evasion booming along so handsome; man
the sweeps, and set her loose! &nbsp;Boys, we done it
elegant!&mdash;'deed we did. &nbsp;I wish WE'D a had the handling
of Louis XVI., there wouldn't a been no 'Son of Saint Louis, ascend
to heaven!' wrote down in HIS biography; no, sir, we'd a whooped
him over the BORDER&mdash;that's what we'd a done with
HIM&mdash;and done it just as slick as nothing at all, too.
&nbsp;Man the sweeps&mdash;man the sweeps!"</p>
<p>But me and Jim was consulting&mdash;and thinking. &nbsp;And
after we'd thought a minute, I says:</p>
<p>"Say it, Jim."</p>
<p>So he says:</p>
<p>"Well, den, dis is de way it look to me, Huck. &nbsp;Ef it wuz
HIM dat 'uz bein' sot free, en one er de boys wuz to git shot,
would he say, 'Go on en save me, nemmine 'bout a doctor f'r to save
dis one?' &nbsp;Is dat like Mars Tom Sawyer? &nbsp;Would he say
dat? &nbsp;You BET he wouldn't! &nbsp;WELL, den, is JIM gywne to
say it? &nbsp;No, sah&mdash;I doan' budge a step out'n dis place
'dout a DOCTOR, not if it's forty year!"</p>
<br />
<br />

width="394" /><br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<p>I knowed he was white inside, and I reckoned he'd say what he
did say&mdash;so it was all right now, and I told Tom I was a-going
for a doctor. &nbsp;He raised considerable row about it, but me and
Jim stuck to it and wouldn't budge; so he was for crawling out and
setting the raft loose himself; but we wouldn't let him. &nbsp;Then
he give us a piece of his mind, but it didn't do no good.</p>
<p>So when he sees me getting the canoe ready, he says:</p>
<p>"Well, then, if you're bound to go, I'll tell you the way to do
when you get to the village. &nbsp;Shut the door and blindfold the
doctor tight and fast, and make him swear to be silent as the
grave, and put a purse full of gold in his hand, and then take and
lead him all around the back alleys and everywheres in the dark,
and then fetch him here in the canoe, in a roundabout way amongst
the islands, and search him and take his chalk away from him, and
don't give it back to him till you get him back to the village, or
else he will chalk this raft so he can find it again. It's the way
they all do."</p>
<p>So I said I would, and left, and Jim was to hide in the woods
when he see the doctor coming till he was gone again.</p>

CHAPTER XLI.</p>
<p>THE doctor was an old man; a very nice, kind-looking old man
when I got him up. &nbsp;I told him me and my brother was over on
Spanish Island hunting yesterday afternoon, and camped on a piece
of a raft we found, and about midnight he must a kicked his gun in
his dreams, for it went off and shot him in the leg, and we wanted
him to go over there and fix it and not say nothing about it, nor
let anybody know, because we wanted to come home this evening and
surprise the folks.</p>
<p>"Who is your folks?" he says.</p>
<p>"The Phelpses, down yonder."</p>
<p>"Oh," he says. &nbsp;And after a minute, he says:</p>
<p>"How'd you say he got shot?"</p>
<p>"He had a dream," I says, "and it shot him."</p>
<p>"Singular dream," he says.</p>
<p>So he lit up his lantern, and got his saddle-bags, and we
started. &nbsp;But when he sees the canoe he didn't like the look
of her&mdash;said she was big enough for one, but didn't look
pretty safe for two. &nbsp;I says:</p>
<p>"Oh, you needn't be afeard, sir, she carried the three of us
easy enough."</p>
<p>"What three?"</p>
<p>"Why, me and Sid, and&mdash;and&mdash;and THE GUNS; that's what
I mean."</p>
<p>"Oh," he says.</p>
<p>But he put his foot on the gunnel and rocked her, and shook his
head, and said he reckoned he'd look around for a bigger one.
&nbsp;But they was all locked and chained; so he took my canoe, and
said for me to wait till he come back, or I could hunt around
further, or maybe I better go down home and get them ready for the
surprise if I wanted to. &nbsp;But I said I didn't; so I told him
just how to find the raft, and then he started.</p>
<p>I struck an idea pretty soon. &nbsp;I says to myself, spos'n he
can't fix that leg just in three shakes of a sheep's tail, as the
saying is? spos'n it takes him three or four days? &nbsp;What are
we going to do?&mdash;lay around there till he lets the cat out of
the bag? &nbsp;No, sir; I know what I'LL do. &nbsp;I'll wait, and
when he comes back if he says he's got to go any more I'll get down
there, too, if I swim; and we'll take and tie him, and keep him,
and shove out down the river; and when Tom's done with him we'll
give him what it's worth, or all we got, and then let him get
ashore.</p>
<p>So then I crept into a lumber-pile to get some sleep; and next
time I waked up the sun was away up over my head! &nbsp;I shot out
and went for the doctor's house, but they told me he'd gone away in
the night some time or other, and warn't back yet. &nbsp;Well,
thinks I, that looks powerful bad for Tom, and I'll dig out for the
island right off. &nbsp;So away I shoved, and turned the corner,
and nearly rammed my head into Uncle Silas's stomach! He says:</p>
<p>"Why, TOM! &nbsp;Where you been all this time, you rascal?"</p>

<p>"I hain't been nowheres," I says, "only just hunting for the
runaway nigger&mdash;me and Sid."</p>
<p>"Why, where ever did you go?" he says. &nbsp;"Your aunt's been
mighty uneasy."</p>
<p>"She needn't," I says, "because we was all right. &nbsp;We
followed the men and the dogs, but they outrun us, and we lost
them; but we thought we heard them on the water, so we got a canoe
and took out after them and crossed over, but couldn't find nothing
of them; so we cruised along up- shore till we got kind of tired
and beat out; and tied up the canoe and went to sleep, and never
waked up till about an hour ago; then we paddled over here to hear
the news, and Sid's at the post-office to see what he can hear, and
I'm a-branching out to get something to eat for us, and then we're
going home."</p>
<p>So then we went to the post-office to get "Sid"; but just as I
suspicioned, he warn't there; so the old man he got a letter out of
the office, and we waited awhile longer, but Sid didn't come; so
the old man said, come along, let Sid foot it home, or canoe it,
when he got done fooling around&mdash;but we would ride. &nbsp;I
couldn't get him to let me stay and wait for Sid; and he said there
warn't no use in it, and I must come along, and let Aunt Sally see
we was all right.</p>
<p>When we got home Aunt Sally was that glad to see me she laughed
and cried both, and hugged me, and give me one of them lickings of
hern that don't amount to shucks, and said she'd serve Sid the same
when he come.</p>
<p>And the place was plum full of farmers and farmers' wives, to
dinner; and such another clack a body never heard. &nbsp;Old Mrs.
Hotchkiss was the worst; her tongue was a-going all the time.
&nbsp;She says:</p>
<p>"Well, Sister Phelps, I've ransacked that-air cabin over, an' I
b'lieve the nigger was crazy. &nbsp;I says to Sister
Damrell&mdash;didn't I, Sister Damrell?&mdash;s'I, he's crazy,
s'I&mdash;them's the very words I said. &nbsp;You all hearn me:
he's crazy, s'I; everything shows it, s'I. &nbsp;Look at that-air
grindstone, s'I; want to tell ME't any cretur 't's in his right
mind 's a goin' to scrabble all them crazy things onto a
grindstone, s'I? &nbsp;Here sich 'n' sich a person busted his
heart; 'n' here so 'n' so pegged along for thirty-seven year, 'n'
all that&mdash;natcherl son o' Louis somebody, 'n' sich everlast'n
rubbage. &nbsp;He's plumb crazy, s'I; it's what I says in the fust
place, it's what I says in the middle, 'n' it's what I says last
'n' all the time&mdash;the nigger's crazy&mdash;crazy 's
Nebokoodneezer, s'I."</p>

<p>"An' look at that-air ladder made out'n rags, Sister Hotchkiss,"
says old Mrs. Damrell; "what in the name o' goodness COULD he ever
want of&mdash;"</p>
<p>"The very words I was a-sayin' no longer ago th'n this minute to
Sister Utterback, 'n' she'll tell you so herself. &nbsp;Sh-she,
look at that-air rag ladder, sh-she; 'n' s'I, yes, LOOK at it,
s'I&mdash;what COULD he a-wanted of it, s'I. &nbsp;Sh-she, Sister
Hotchkiss, sh-she&mdash;"</p>
<p>"But how in the nation'd they ever GIT that grindstone IN there,
ANYWAY? 'n' who dug that-air HOLE? 'n' who&mdash;"</p>
<p>"My very WORDS, Brer Penrod! &nbsp;I was a-sayin'&mdash;pass
that-air sasser o' m'lasses, won't ye?&mdash;I was a-sayin' to
Sister Dunlap, jist this minute, how DID they git that grindstone
in there, s'I. &nbsp;Without HELP, mind you&mdash;'thout HELP!
&nbsp;THAT'S wher 'tis. &nbsp;Don't tell ME, s'I; there WUZ help,
s'I; 'n' ther' wuz a PLENTY help, too, s'I; ther's ben a DOZEN
a-helpin' that nigger, 'n' I lay I'd skin every last nigger on this
place but I'D find out who done it, s'I; 'n' moreover,
s'I&mdash;"</p>
<p>"A DOZEN says you!&mdash;FORTY couldn't a done every thing
that's been done. Look at them case-knife saws and things, how
tedious they've been made; look at that bed-leg sawed off with 'm,
a week's work for six men; look at that nigger made out'n straw on
the bed; and look at&mdash;"</p>
<p>"You may WELL say it, Brer Hightower! &nbsp;It's jist as I was
a-sayin' to Brer Phelps, his own self. &nbsp;S'e, what do YOU think
of it, Sister Hotchkiss, s'e? Think o' what, Brer Phelps, s'I?
&nbsp;Think o' that bed-leg sawed off that a way, s'e? &nbsp;THINK
of it, s'I? &nbsp;I lay it never sawed ITSELF off,
s'I&mdash;somebody SAWED it, s'I; that's my opinion, take it or
leave it, it mayn't be no 'count, s'I, but sich as 't is, it's my
opinion, s'I, 'n' if any body k'n start a better one, s'I, let him
DO it, s'I, that's all. &nbsp;I says to Sister Dunlap,
s'I&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Why, dog my cats, they must a ben a house-full o' niggers in
there every night for four weeks to a done all that work, Sister
Phelps. &nbsp;Look at that shirt&mdash;every last inch of it
kivered over with secret African writ'n done with blood! &nbsp;Must
a ben a raft uv 'm at it right along, all the time, amost.
&nbsp;Why, I'd give two dollars to have it read to me; 'n' as for
the niggers that wrote it, I 'low I'd take 'n' lash 'm
t'll&mdash;"</p>
<p>"People to HELP him, Brother Marples! &nbsp;Well, I reckon you'd
THINK so if you'd a been in this house for a while back. &nbsp;Why,
they've stole everything they could lay their hands on&mdash;and we
a-watching all the time, mind you. They stole that shirt right off
o' the line! and as for that sheet they made the rag ladder out of,
ther' ain't no telling how many times they DIDN'T steal that; and
flour, and candles, and candlesticks, and spoons, and the old
warming-pan, and most a thousand things that I disremember now, and
my new calico dress; and me and Silas and my Sid and Tom on the
constant watch day AND night, as I was a-telling you, and not a one
of us could catch hide nor hair nor sight nor sound of them; and
here at the last minute, lo and behold you, they slides right in
under our noses and fools us, and not only fools US but the Injun
Territory robbers too, and actuly gets AWAY with that nigger safe
and sound, and that with sixteen men and twenty-two dogs right on
their very heels at that very time! &nbsp;I tell you, it just bangs
anything I ever HEARD of. Why, SPERITS couldn't a done better and
been no smarter. And I reckon they must a BEEN
sperits&mdash;because, YOU know our dogs, and ther' ain't no
better; well, them dogs never even got on the TRACK of 'm once!
&nbsp;You explain THAT to me if you can!&mdash;ANY of you!"</p>
<p>"Well, it does beat&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Laws alive, I never&mdash;"</p>
<p>"So help me, I wouldn't a be&mdash;"</p>
<p>"HOUSE-thieves as well as&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Goodnessgracioussakes, I'd a ben afeard to live in sich
a&mdash;"</p>
<p>"'Fraid to LIVE!&mdash;why, I was that scared I dasn't hardly go
to bed, or get up, or lay down, or SET down, Sister Ridgeway.
&nbsp;Why, they'd steal the very&mdash;why, goodness sakes, you can
guess what kind of a fluster I was in by the time midnight come
last night. &nbsp;I hope to gracious if I warn't afraid they'd
steal some o' the family! &nbsp;I was just to that pass I didn't
have no reasoning faculties no more. &nbsp;It looks foolish enough
NOW, in the daytime; but I says to myself, there's my two poor boys
asleep, 'way up stairs in that lonesome room, and I declare to
goodness I was that uneasy 't I crep' up there and locked 'em in!
&nbsp;I DID. &nbsp;And anybody would. Because, you know, when you
get scared that way, and it keeps running on, and getting worse and
worse all the time, and your wits gets to addling, and you get to
doing all sorts o' wild things, and by and by you think to
yourself, spos'n I was a boy, and was away up there, and the door
ain't locked, and you&mdash;" She stopped, looking kind of
wondering, and then she turned her head around slow, and when her
eye lit on me&mdash;I got up and took a walk.</p>
<p>Says I to myself, I can explain better how we come to not be in
that room this morning if I go out to one side and study over it a
little. &nbsp;So I done it. &nbsp;But I dasn't go fur, or she'd a
sent for me. &nbsp;And when it was late in the day the people all
went, and then I come in and told her the noise and shooting waked
up me and "Sid," and the door was locked, and we wanted to see the
fun, so we went down the lightning-rod, and both of us got hurt a
little, and we didn't never want to try THAT no more. &nbsp;And
then I went on and told her all what I told Uncle Silas before; and
then she said she'd forgive us, and maybe it was all right enough
anyway, and about what a body might expect of boys, for all boys
was a pretty harum- scarum lot as fur as she could see; and so, as
long as no harm hadn't come of it, she judged she better put in her
time being grateful we was alive and well and she had us still,
stead of fretting over what was past and done. &nbsp;So then she
kissed me, and patted me on the head, and dropped into a kind of a
brown study; and pretty soon jumps up, and says:</p>
<p>"Why, lawsamercy, it's most night, and Sid not come yet!
&nbsp;What HAS become of that boy?"</p>
<p>I see my chance; so I skips up and says:</p>
<p>"I'll run right up to town and get him," I says.</p>
<p>"No you won't," she says. &nbsp;"You'll stay right wher' you
are; ONE'S enough to be lost at a time. &nbsp;If he ain't here to
supper, your uncle 'll go."</p>
<p>Well, he warn't there to supper; so right after supper uncle
went.</p>
<p>He come back about ten a little bit uneasy; hadn't run across
Tom's track. Aunt Sally was a good DEAL uneasy; but Uncle Silas he
said there warn't no occasion to be&mdash;boys will be boys, he
said, and you'll see this one turn up in the morning all sound and
right. &nbsp;So she had to be satisfied. &nbsp;But she said she'd
set up for him a while anyway, and keep a light burning so he could
see it.</p>

<br />
<br />
<p>And then when I went up to bed she come up with me and fetched
her candle, and tucked me in, and mothered me so good I felt mean,
and like I couldn't look her in the face; and she set down on the
bed and talked with me a long time, and said what a splendid boy
Sid was, and didn't seem to want to ever stop talking about him;
and kept asking me every now and then if I reckoned he could a got
lost, or hurt, or maybe drownded, and might be laying at this
minute somewheres suffering or dead, and she not by him to help
him, and so the tears would drip down silent, and I would tell her
that Sid was all right, and would be home in the morning, sure; and
she would squeeze my hand, or maybe kiss me, and tell me to say it
again, and keep on saying it, because it done her good, and she was
in so much trouble. &nbsp;And when she was going away she looked
down in my eyes so steady and gentle, and says:</p>
<p>"The door ain't going to be locked, Tom, and there's the window
and the rod; but you'll be good, WON'T you? &nbsp;And you won't go?
&nbsp;For MY sake."</p>
<p>Laws knows I WANTED to go bad enough to see about Tom, and was
all intending to go; but after that I wouldn't a went, not for
kingdoms.</p>
<p>But she was on my mind and Tom was on my mind, so I slept very
restless. And twice I went down the rod away in the night, and
slipped around front, and see her setting there by her candle in
the window with her eyes towards the road and the tears in them;
and I wished I could do something for her, but I couldn't, only to
swear that I wouldn't never do nothing to grieve her any more.
&nbsp;And the third time I waked up at dawn, and slid down, and she
was there yet, and her candle was most out, and her old gray head
was resting on her hand, and she was asleep.</p>

CHAPTER XLII.</p>
<p>THE old man was uptown again before breakfast, but couldn't get
no track of Tom; and both of them set at the table thinking, and
not saying nothing, and looking mournful, and their coffee getting
cold, and not eating anything. And by and by the old man says:</p>
<p>"Did I give you the letter?"</p>
<p>"What letter?"</p>
<p>"The one I got yesterday out of the post-office."</p>
<p>"No, you didn't give me no letter."</p>
<p>"Well, I must a forgot it."</p>
<p>So he rummaged his pockets, and then went off somewheres where
he had laid it down, and fetched it, and give it to her. &nbsp;She
says:</p>
<p>"Why, it's from St. Petersburg&mdash;it's from Sis."</p>
<p>I allowed another walk would do me good; but I couldn't stir.
&nbsp;But before she could break it open she dropped it and
run&mdash;for she see something. And so did I. It was Tom Sawyer on
a mattress; and that old doctor; and Jim, in HER calico dress, with
his hands tied behind him; and a lot of people. &nbsp;I hid the
letter behind the first thing that come handy, and rushed.
&nbsp;She flung herself at Tom, crying, and says:</p>
<p>"Oh, he's dead, he's dead, I know he's dead!"</p>
<p>And Tom he turned his head a little, and muttered something or
other, which showed he warn't in his right mind; then she flung up
her hands, and says:</p>
<p>"He's alive, thank God! &nbsp;And that's enough!" and she
snatched a kiss of him, and flew for the house to get the bed
ready, and scattering orders right and left at the niggers and
everybody else, as fast as her tongue could go, every jump of the
way.</p>
<p>I followed the men to see what they was going to do with Jim;
and the old doctor and Uncle Silas followed after Tom into the
house. &nbsp;The men was very huffy, and some of them wanted to
hang Jim for an example to all the other niggers around there, so
they wouldn't be trying to run away like Jim done, and making such
a raft of trouble, and keeping a whole family scared most to death
for days and nights. &nbsp;But the others said, don't do it, it
wouldn't answer at all; he ain't our nigger, and his owner would
turn up and make us pay for him, sure. &nbsp;So that cooled them
down a little, because the people that's always the most anxious
for to hang a nigger that hain't done just right is always the very
ones that ain't the most anxious to pay for him when they've got
their satisfaction out of him.</p>
<p>They cussed Jim considerble, though, and give him a cuff or two
side the head once in a while, but Jim never said nothing, and he
never let on to know me, and they took him to the same cabin, and
put his own clothes on him, and chained him again, and not to no
bed-leg this time, but to a big staple drove into the bottom log,
and chained his hands, too, and both legs, and said he warn't to
have nothing but bread and water to eat after this till his owner
come, or he was sold at auction because he didn't come in a certain
length of time, and filled up our hole, and said a couple of
farmers with guns must stand watch around about the cabin every
night, and a bulldog tied to the door in the daytime; and about
this time they was through with the job and was tapering off with a
kind of generl good-bye cussing, and then the old doctor comes and
takes a look, and says:</p>
<p>"Don't be no rougher on him than you're obleeged to, because he
ain't a bad nigger. &nbsp;When I got to where I found the boy I see
I couldn't cut the bullet out without some help, and he warn't in
no condition for me to leave to go and get help; and he got a
little worse and a little worse, and after a long time he went out
of his head, and wouldn't let me come a-nigh him any more, and said
if I chalked his raft he'd kill me, and no end of wild foolishness
like that, and I see I couldn't do anything at all with him; so I
says, I got to have HELP somehow; and the minute I says it out
crawls this nigger from somewheres and says he'll help, and he done
it, too, and done it very well. &nbsp;Of course I judged he must be
a runaway nigger, and there I WAS! and there I had to stick right
straight along all the rest of the day and all night. &nbsp;It was
a fix, I tell you! I had a couple of patients with the chills, and
of course I'd of liked to run up to town and see them, but I
dasn't, because the nigger might get away, and then I'd be to
blame; and yet never a skiff come close enough for me to hail.
&nbsp;So there I had to stick plumb until daylight this morning;
and I never see a nigger that was a better nuss or faithfuller, and
yet he was risking his freedom to do it, and was all tired out,
too, and I see plain enough he'd been worked main hard lately.
&nbsp;I liked the nigger for that; I tell you, gentlemen, a nigger
like that is worth a thousand dollars&mdash;and kind treatment,
too. &nbsp;I had everything I needed, and the boy was doing as well
there as he would a done at home&mdash;better, maybe, because it
was so quiet; but there I WAS, with both of 'm on my hands, and
there I had to stick till about dawn this morning; then some men in
a skiff come by, and as good luck would have it the nigger was
setting by the pallet with his head propped on his knees sound
asleep; so I motioned them in quiet, and they slipped up on him and
grabbed him and tied him before he knowed what he was about, and we
never had no trouble. And the boy being in a kind of a flighty
sleep, too, we muffled the oars and hitched the raft on, and towed
her over very nice and quiet, and the nigger never made the least
row nor said a word from the start. &nbsp;He ain't no bad nigger,
gentlemen; that's what I think about him."</p>

<br />
<br />
<p>Somebody says:</p>
<p>"Well, it sounds very good, doctor, I'm obleeged to say."</p>
<p>Then the others softened up a little, too, and I was mighty
thankful to that old doctor for doing Jim that good turn; and I was
glad it was according to my judgment of him, too; because I thought
he had a good heart in him and was a good man the first time I see
him. &nbsp;Then they all agreed that Jim had acted very well, and
was deserving to have some notice took of it, and reward. &nbsp;So
every one of them promised, right out and hearty, that they
wouldn't cuss him no more.</p>
<p>Then they come out and locked him up. &nbsp;I hoped they was
going to say he could have one or two of the chains took off,
because they was rotten heavy, or could have meat and greens with
his bread and water; but they didn't think of it, and I reckoned it
warn't best for me to mix in, but I judged I'd get the doctor's
yarn to Aunt Sally somehow or other as soon as I'd got through the
breakers that was laying just ahead of me&mdash;explanations, I
mean, of how I forgot to mention about Sid being shot when I was
telling how him and me put in that dratted night paddling around
hunting the runaway nigger.</p>
<p>But I had plenty time. &nbsp;Aunt Sally she stuck to the
sick-room all day and all night, and every time I see Uncle Silas
mooning around I dodged him.</p>
<p>Next morning I heard Tom was a good deal better, and they said
Aunt Sally was gone to get a nap. &nbsp;So I slips to the
sick-room, and if I found him awake I reckoned we could put up a
yarn for the family that would wash. But he was sleeping, and
sleeping very peaceful, too; and pale, not fire- faced the way he
was when he come. &nbsp;So I set down and laid for him to wake.
&nbsp;In about half an hour Aunt Sally comes gliding in, and there
I was, up a stump again! &nbsp;She motioned me to be still, and set
down by me, and begun to whisper, and said we could all be joyful
now, because all the symptoms was first-rate, and he'd been
sleeping like that for ever so long, and looking better and
peacefuller all the time, and ten to one he'd wake up in his right
mind.</p>
<p>So we set there watching, and by and by he stirs a bit, and
opened his eyes very natural, and takes a look, and says:</p>
<p>"Hello!&mdash;why, I'm at HOME! &nbsp;How's that? &nbsp;Where's
the raft?"</p>
<p>"It's all right," I says.</p>
<p>"And JIM?"</p>
<p>"The same," I says, but couldn't say it pretty brash. &nbsp;But
he never noticed, but says:</p>
<p>"Good! &nbsp;Splendid! &nbsp;NOW we're all right and safe! Did
you tell Aunty?"</p>
<p>I was going to say yes; but she chipped in and says:
&nbsp;"About what, Sid?"</p>
<p>"Why, about the way the whole thing was done."</p>
<p>"What whole thing?"</p>
<p>"Why, THE whole thing. &nbsp;There ain't but one; how we set the
runaway nigger free&mdash;me and Tom."</p>
<p>"Good land! &nbsp;Set the run&mdash;What IS the child talking
about! &nbsp;Dear, dear, out of his head again!"</p>
<p>"NO, I ain't out of my HEAD; I know all what I'm talking about.
&nbsp;We DID set him free&mdash;me and Tom. &nbsp;We laid out to do
it, and we DONE it. &nbsp;And we done it elegant, too." &nbsp;He'd
got a start, and she never checked him up, just set and stared and
stared, and let him clip along, and I see it warn't no use for ME
to put in. &nbsp;"Why, Aunty, it cost us a power of
work&mdash;weeks of it&mdash;hours and hours, every night, whilst
you was all asleep. And we had to steal candles, and the sheet, and
the shirt, and your dress, and spoons, and tin plates, and
case-knives, and the warming-pan, and the grindstone, and flour,
and just no end of things, and you can't think what work it was to
make the saws, and pens, and inscriptions, and one thing or
another, and you can't think HALF the fun it was. &nbsp;And we had
to make up the pictures of coffins and things, and nonnamous
letters from the robbers, and get up and down the lightning-rod,
and dig the hole into the cabin, and made the rope ladder and send
it in cooked up in a pie, and send in spoons and things to work
with in your apron pocket&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Mercy sakes!"</p>
<p>"&mdash;and load up the cabin with rats and snakes and so on,
for company for Jim; and then you kept Tom here so long with the
butter in his hat that you come near spiling the whole business,
because the men come before we was out of the cabin, and we had to
rush, and they heard us and let drive at us, and I got my share,
and we dodged out of the path and let them go by, and when the dogs
come they warn't interested in us, but went for the most noise, and
we got our canoe, and made for the raft, and was all safe, and Jim
was a free man, and we done it all by ourselves, and WASN'T it
bully, Aunty!"</p>
<p>"Well, I never heard the likes of it in all my born days!
&nbsp;So it was YOU, you little rapscallions, that's been making
all this trouble, and turned everybody's wits clean inside out and
scared us all most to death. &nbsp;I've as good a notion as ever I
had in my life to take it out o' you this very minute. &nbsp;To
think, here I've been, night after night, a&mdash;YOU just get well
once, you young scamp, and I lay I'll tan the Old Harry out o' both
o' ye!"</p>
<p>But Tom, he WAS so proud and joyful, he just COULDN'T hold in,
and his tongue just WENT it&mdash;she a-chipping in, and spitting
fire all along, and both of them going it at once, like a cat
convention; and she says:</p>
<p>"WELL, you get all the enjoyment you can out of it NOW, for mind
I tell you if I catch you meddling with him again&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Meddling with WHO?" &nbsp;Tom says, dropping his smile and
looking surprised.</p>
<p>"With WHO? &nbsp;Why, the runaway nigger, of course. &nbsp;Who'd
you reckon?"</p>
<p>Tom looks at me very grave, and says:</p>
<p>"Tom, didn't you just tell me he was all right? &nbsp;Hasn't he
got away?"</p>
<p>"HIM?" says Aunt Sally; "the runaway nigger? &nbsp;'Deed he
hasn't. &nbsp;They've got him back, safe and sound, and he's in
that cabin again, on bread and water, and loaded down with chains,
till he's claimed or sold!"</p>

<br />
<p>Tom rose square up in bed, with his eye hot, and his nostrils
opening and shutting like gills, and sings out to me:</p>
<p>"They hain't no RIGHT to shut him up! &nbsp;SHOVE!&mdash;and
don't you lose a minute. &nbsp;Turn him loose! he ain't no slave;
he's as free as any cretur that walks this earth!"</p>
<p>"What DOES the child mean?"</p>
<p>"I mean every word I SAY, Aunt Sally, and if somebody don't go,
I'LL go. I've knowed him all his life, and so has Tom, there.
&nbsp;Old Miss Watson died two months ago, and she was ashamed she
ever was going to sell him down the river, and SAID so; and she set
him free in her will."</p>
<p>"Then what on earth did YOU want to set him free for, seeing he
was already free?"</p>
<p>"Well, that IS a question, I must say; and just like women!
&nbsp;Why, I wanted the ADVENTURE of it; and I'd a waded neck-deep
in blood to&mdash;goodness alive, AUNT POLLY!"</p>
<p>If she warn't standing right there, just inside the door,
looking as sweet and contented as an angel half full of pie, I wish
I may never!</p>
<p>Aunt Sally jumped for her, and most hugged the head off of her,
and cried over her, and I found a good enough place for me under
the bed, for it was getting pretty sultry for us, seemed to me.
&nbsp;And I peeped out, and in a little while Tom's Aunt Polly
shook herself loose and stood there looking across at Tom over her
spectacles&mdash;kind of grinding him into the earth, you know.
&nbsp;And then she says:</p>
<p>"Yes, you BETTER turn y'r head away&mdash;I would if I was you,
Tom."</p>
<p>"Oh, deary me!" says Aunt Sally; "IS he changed so? &nbsp;Why,
that ain't TOM, it's Sid; Tom's&mdash;Tom's&mdash;why, where is
Tom? &nbsp;He was here a minute ago."</p>
<p>"You mean where's Huck FINN&mdash;that's what you mean! &nbsp;I
reckon I hain't raised such a scamp as my Tom all these years not
to know him when I SEE him. &nbsp;That WOULD be a pretty howdy-do.
Come out from under that bed, Huck Finn."</p>
<p>So I done it. &nbsp;But not feeling brash.</p>
<p>Aunt Sally she was one of the mixed-upest-looking persons I ever
see&mdash;except one, and that was Uncle Silas, when he come in and
they told it all to him. &nbsp;It kind of made him drunk, as you
may say, and he didn't know nothing at all the rest of the day, and
preached a prayer-meeting sermon that night that gave him a
rattling ruputation, because the oldest man in the world couldn't a
understood it. &nbsp;So Tom's Aunt Polly, she told all about who I
was, and what; and I had to up and tell how I was in such a tight
place that when Mrs. Phelps took me for Tom Sawyer&mdash;she
chipped in and says, "Oh, go on and call me Aunt Sally, I'm used to
it now, and 'tain't no need to change"&mdash;that when Aunt Sally
took me for Tom Sawyer I had to stand it&mdash;there warn't no
other way, and I knowed he wouldn't mind, because it would be nuts
for him, being a mystery, and he'd make an adventure out of it, and
be perfectly satisfied. &nbsp;And so it turned out, and he let on
to be Sid, and made things as soft as he could for me.</p>
<p>And his Aunt Polly she said Tom was right about old Miss Watson
setting Jim free in her will; and so, sure enough, Tom Sawyer had
gone and took all that trouble and bother to set a free nigger
free! and I couldn't ever understand before, until that minute and
that talk, how he COULD help a body set a nigger free with his
bringing-up.</p>
<p>Well, Aunt Polly she said that when Aunt Sally wrote to her that
Tom and SID had come all right and safe, she says to herself:</p>
<p>"Look at that, now! &nbsp;I might have expected it, letting him
go off that way without anybody to watch him. &nbsp;So now I got to
go and trapse all the way down the river, eleven hundred mile, and
find out what that creetur's up to THIS time, as long as I couldn't
seem to get any answer out of you about it."</p>
<p>"Why, I never heard nothing from you," says Aunt Sally.</p>
<p>"Well, I wonder! &nbsp;Why, I wrote you twice to ask you what
you could mean by Sid being here."</p>
<p>"Well, I never got 'em, Sis."</p>
<p>Aunt Polly she turns around slow and severe, and says:</p>
<p>"You, Tom!"</p>
<p>"Well&mdash;WHAT?" he says, kind of pettish.</p>
<p>"Don t you what ME, you impudent thing&mdash;hand out them
letters."</p>

<br />
<p>"What letters?"</p>
<p>"THEM letters. &nbsp;I be bound, if I have to take a-holt of you
I'll&mdash;"</p>
<p>"They're in the trunk. &nbsp;There, now. &nbsp;And they're just
the same as they was when I got them out of the office. &nbsp;I
hain't looked into them, I hain't touched them. &nbsp;But I knowed
they'd make trouble, and I thought if you warn't in no hurry,
I'd&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Well, you DO need skinning, there ain't no mistake about it.
&nbsp;And I wrote another one to tell you I was coming; and I
s'pose he&mdash;"</p>
<p>"No, it come yesterday; I hain't read it yet, but IT'S all
right, I've got that one."</p>
<p>I wanted to offer to bet two dollars she hadn't, but I reckoned
maybe it was just as safe to not to. &nbsp;So I never said
nothing.</p>

CHAPTER THE LAST</p>
<p>THE first time I catched Tom private I asked him what was his
idea, time of the evasion?&mdash;what it was he'd planned to do if
the evasion worked all right and he managed to set a nigger free
that was already free before? And he said, what he had planned in
his head from the start, if we got Jim out all safe, was for us to
run him down the river on the raft, and have adventures plumb to
the mouth of the river, and then tell him about his being free, and
take him back up home on a steamboat, in style, and pay him for his
lost time, and write word ahead and get out all the niggers around,
and have them waltz him into town with a torchlight procession and
a brass-band, and then he would be a hero, and so would we.
&nbsp;But I reckoned it was about as well the way it was.</p>
<p>We had Jim out of the chains in no time, and when Aunt Polly and
Uncle Silas and Aunt Sally found out how good he helped the doctor
nurse Tom, they made a heap of fuss over him, and fixed him up
prime, and give him all he wanted to eat, and a good time, and
nothing to do. &nbsp;And we had him up to the sick-room, and had a
high talk; and Tom give Jim forty dollars for being prisoner for us
so patient, and doing it up so good, and Jim was pleased most to
death, and busted out, and says:</p>
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<a name="c43-365" id="c43-365"></a><br />
<br />
<img alt="c43-365.jpg (24K)" src="images/c43-365.jpg" height="453"
width="299" /><br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<p>"DAH, now, Huck, what I tell you?&mdash;what I tell you up dah
on Jackson islan'? &nbsp;I TOLE you I got a hairy breas', en what's
de sign un it; en I TOLE you I ben rich wunst, en gwineter to be
rich AGIN; en it's come true; en heah she is! &nbsp;DAH, now! doan'
talk to ME&mdash;signs is SIGNS, mine I tell you; en I knowed jis'
's well 'at I 'uz gwineter be rich agin as I's a-stannin' heah dis
minute!"</p>
<p>And then Tom he talked along and talked along, and says, le's
all three slide out of here one of these nights and get an outfit,
and go for howling adventures amongst the Injuns, over in the
Territory, for a couple of weeks or two; and I says, all right,
that suits me, but I ain't got no money for to buy the outfit, and
I reckon I couldn't get none from home, because it's likely pap's
been back before now, and got it all away from Judge Thatcher and
drunk it up.</p>
<p>"No, he hain't," Tom says; "it's all there yet&mdash;six
thousand dollars and more; and your pap hain't ever been back
since. &nbsp;Hadn't when I come away, anyhow."</p>
<p>Jim says, kind of solemn:</p>
<p>"He ain't a-comin' back no mo', Huck."</p>
<p>I says:</p>
<p>"Why, Jim?"</p>
<p>"Nemmine why, Huck&mdash;but he ain't comin' back no mo."</p>
<p>But I kept at him; so at last he says:</p>
<p>"Doan' you 'member de house dat was float'n down de river, en
dey wuz a man in dah, kivered up, en I went in en unkivered him and
didn' let you come in? &nbsp;Well, den, you kin git yo' money when
you wants it, kase dat wuz him."</p>
<p>Tom's most well now, and got his bullet around his neck on a
watch-guard for a watch, and is always seeing what time it is, and
so there ain't nothing more to write about, and I am rotten glad of
it, because if I'd a knowed what a trouble it was to make a book I
wouldn't a tackled it, and ain't a-going to no more. &nbsp;But I
reckon I got to light out for the Territory ahead of the rest,
because Aunt Sally she's going to adopt me and sivilize me, and I
can't stand it. &nbsp;I been there before.</p>
<p>THE END. YOURS TRULY, HUCK FINN.</p>

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
