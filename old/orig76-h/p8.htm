CHAPTER XXXVI.</p>

<p>AS soon as we reckoned everybody was asleep that night we went
down the lightning-rod, and shut ourselves up in the lean-to, and
got out our pile of fox-fire, and went to work.  We cleared
everything out of the way, about four or five foot along the
middle of the bottom log.  Tom said he was right behind Jim's bed
now, and we'd dig in under it, and when we got through there
couldn't nobody in the cabin ever know there was any hole there,
because Jim's counter-pin hung down most to the ground, and you'd
have to raise it up and look under to see the hole.  So we dug
and dug with the case-knives till most midnight; and then we was
dog-tired, and our hands was blistered, and yet you couldn't see
we'd done anything hardly.  At last I says:</p>

<p>"This ain't no thirty-seven year job; this is a thirty-eight
year job, Tom Sawyer."</p>

<p>He never said nothing.  But he sighed, and pretty soon he
stopped digging, and then for a good little while I knowed that
he was thinking. Then he says:</p>

<p>"It ain't no use, Huck, it ain't a-going to work.  If we was
prisoners it would, because then we'd have as many years as we
wanted, and no hurry; and we wouldn't get but a few minutes to
dig, every day, while they was changing watches, and so our hands
wouldn't get blistered, and we could keep it up right along, year
in and year out, and do it right, and the way it ought to be
done.  But WE can't fool along; we got to rush; we ain't got no
time to spare.  If we was to put in another night this way we'd
have to knock off for a week to let our hands get
well&mdash;couldn't touch a case-knife with them sooner."</p>

<p>"Well, then, what we going to do, Tom?"</p>

<p>"I'll tell you.  It ain't right, and it ain't moral, and I
wouldn't like it to get out; but there ain't only just the one
way:  we got to dig him out with the picks, and LET ON it's
case-knives."</p>

<p>"NOW you're TALKING!"  I says; "your head gets leveler and
leveler all the time, Tom Sawyer," I says.  "Picks is the thing,
moral or no moral; and as for me, I don't care shucks for the
morality of it, nohow.  When I start in to steal a nigger, or a
watermelon, or a Sunday-school book, I ain't no ways particular
how it's done so it's done.  What I want is my nigger; or what I
want is my watermelon; or what I want is my Sunday- school book;
and if a pick's the handiest thing, that's the thing I'm a- going
to dig that nigger or that watermelon or that Sunday-school book
out with; and I don't give a dead rat what the authorities thinks
about it nuther."</p>

<p>"Well," he says, "there's excuse for picks and letting-on in a
case like this; if it warn't so, I wouldn't approve of it, nor I
wouldn't stand by and see the rules broke&mdash;because right is
right, and wrong is wrong, and a body ain't got no business doing
wrong when he ain't ignorant and knows better.  It might answer
for YOU to dig Jim out with a pick, WITHOUT any letting on,
because you don't know no better; but it wouldn't for me, because
I do know better.  Gimme a case-knife."</p>

<p>He had his own by him, but I handed him mine.  He flung it
down, and says:</p>

<p>"Gimme a CASE-KNIFE."</p>

<p>I didn't know just what to do&mdash;but then I thought.  I
scratched around amongst the old tools, and got a pickaxe and
give it to him, and he took it and went to work, and never said a
word.</p>

<p>He was always just that particular.  Full of principle.</p>

<p>So then I got a shovel, and then we picked and shoveled, turn
about, and made the fur fly.  We stuck to it about a half an
hour, which was as long as we could stand up; but we had a good
deal of a hole to show for it. When I got up stairs I looked out
at the window and see Tom doing his level best with the
lightning-rod, but he couldn't come it, his hands was so sore.
 At last he says:</p>

<p>"It ain't no use, it can't be done.  What you reckon I better
do?  Can't you think of no way?"</p>

<p>"Yes," I says, "but I reckon it ain't regular.  Come up the
stairs, and let on it's a lightning-rod."</p>

<p>So he done it.</p>

<br>


<p>Next day Tom stole a pewter spoon and a brass candlestick in
the house, for to make some pens for Jim out of, and six tallow
candles; and I hung around the nigger cabins and laid for a
chance, and stole three tin plates.  Tom says it wasn't enough;
but I said nobody wouldn't ever see the plates that Jim throwed
out, because they'd fall in the dog-fennel and jimpson weeds
under the window-hole&mdash;then we could tote them back and he
could use them over again.  So Tom was satisfied.  Then he
says:</p>

<p>"Now, the thing to study out is, how to get the things to
Jim."</p>

<p>"Take them in through the hole," I says, "when we get it
done."</p>

<p>He only just looked scornful, and said something about nobody
ever heard of such an idiotic idea, and then he went to studying.
 By and by he said he had ciphered out two or three ways, but
there warn't no need to decide on any of them yet.  Said we'd got
to post Jim first.</p>

<p>That night we went down the lightning-rod a little after ten,
and took one of the candles along, and listened under the
window-hole, and heard Jim snoring; so we pitched it in, and it
didn't wake him.  Then we whirled in with the pick and shovel,
and in about two hours and a half the job was done.  We crept in
under Jim's bed and into the cabin, and pawed around and found
the candle and lit it, and stood over Jim awhile, and found him
looking hearty and healthy, and then we woke him up gentle and
gradual.  He was so glad to see us he most cried; and called us
honey, and all the pet names he could think of; and was for
having us hunt up a cold-chisel to cut the chain off of his leg
with right away, and clearing out without losing any time.  But
Tom he showed him how unregular it would be, and set down and
told him all about our plans, and how we could alter them in a
minute any time there was an alarm; and not to be the least
afraid, because we would see he got away, SURE.  So Jim he said
it was all right, and we set there and talked over old times
awhile, and then Tom asked a lot of questions, and when Jim told
him Uncle Silas come in every day or two to pray with him, and
Aunt Sally come in to see if he was comfortable and had plenty to
eat, and both of them was kind as they could be, Tom says:</p>

<p>"NOW I know how to fix it.  We'll send you some things by
them."</p>

<p>I said, "Don't do nothing of the kind; it's one of the most
jackass ideas I ever struck;" but he never paid no attention to
me; went right on.  It was his way when he'd got his plans
set.</p>

<p>So he told Jim how we'd have to smuggle in the rope-ladder pie
and other large things by Nat, the nigger that fed him, and he
must be on the lookout, and not be surprised, and not let Nat see
him open them; and we would put small things in uncle's
coat-pockets and he must steal them out; and we would tie things
to aunt's apron-strings or put them in her apron-pocket, if we
got a chance; and told him what they would be and what they was
for.  And told him how to keep a journal on the shirt with his
blood, and all that. He told him everything.  Jim he couldn't see
no sense in the most of it, but he allowed we was white folks and
knowed better than him; so he was satisfied, and said he would do
it all just as Tom said.</p>

<p>Jim had plenty corn-cob pipes and tobacco; so we had a right
down good sociable time; then we crawled out through the hole,
and so home to bed, with hands that looked like they'd been
chawed.  Tom was in high spirits. He said it was the best fun he
ever had in his life, and the most intellectural; and said if he
only could see his way to it we would keep it up all the rest of
our lives and leave Jim to our children to get out; for he
believed Jim would come to like it better and better the more he
got used to it.  He said that in that way it could be strung out
to as much as eighty year, and would be the best time on record.
 And he said it would make us all celebrated that had a hand in
it.</p>

<p>In the morning we went out to the woodpile and chopped up the
brass candlestick into handy sizes, and Tom put them and the
pewter spoon in his pocket.  Then we went to the nigger cabins,
and while I got Nat's notice off, Tom shoved a piece of
candlestick into the middle of a corn- pone that was in Jim's
pan, and we went along with Nat to see how it would work, and it
just worked noble; when Jim bit into it it most mashed all his
teeth out; and there warn't ever anything could a worked better.
Tom said so himself. Jim he never let on but what it was only
just a piece of rock or something like that that's always getting
into bread, you know; but after that he never bit into nothing
but what he jabbed his fork into it in three or four places
first.</p>

<p>And whilst we was a-standing there in the dimmish light, here
comes a couple of the hounds bulging in from under Jim's bed; and
they kept on piling in till there was eleven of them, and there
warn't hardly room in there to get your breath.  By jings, we
forgot to fasten that lean-to door!  The nigger Nat he only just
hollered "Witches" once, and keeled over on to the floor amongst
the dogs, and begun to groan like he was dying.  Tom jerked the
door open and flung out a slab of Jim's meat, and the dogs went
for it, and in two seconds he was out himself and back again and
shut the door, and I knowed he'd fixed the other door too. Then
he went to work on the nigger, coaxing him and petting him, and
asking him if he'd been imagining he saw something again.  He
raised up, and blinked his eyes around, and says:</p>

<p>"Mars Sid, you'll say I's a fool, but if I didn't b'lieve I
see most a million dogs, er devils, er some'n, I wisht I may die
right heah in dese tracks.  I did, mos' sholy.  Mars Sid, I FELT
um&mdash;I FELT um, sah; dey was all over me.  Dad fetch it, I
jis' wisht I could git my han's on one er dem witches jis'
wunst&mdash;on'y jis' wunst&mdash;it's all I'd ast.  But mos'ly I
wisht dey'd lemme 'lone, I does."</p>

<p>Tom says:</p>

<p>"Well, I tell you what I think.  What makes them come here
just at this runaway nigger's breakfast-time?  It's because
they're hungry; that's the reason.  You make them a witch pie;
that's the thing for YOU to do."</p>

<p>"Well, then, I'll have to make it myself."</p>

<p>"Will you do it, honey?&mdash;will you?  I'll wusshup de
groun' und' yo' foot, I will!"</p>

<p>"All right, I'll do it, seeing it's you, and you've been good
to us and showed us the runaway nigger.  But you got to be mighty
careful.  When we come around, you turn your back; and then
whatever we've put in the pan, don't you let on you see it at
all.  And don't you look when Jim unloads the pan&mdash;something
might happen, I don't know what.  And above all, don't you HANDLE
the witch-things."</p>

<p>"HANNEL 'm, Mars Sid?  What IS you a-talkin' 'bout?  I wouldn'

CHAPTER XXXVII.</p>

<p>THAT was all fixed.  So then we went away and went to the
rubbage-pile in the back yard, where they keep the old boots, and
rags, and pieces of bottles, and wore-out tin things, and all
such truck, and scratched around and found an old tin washpan,
and stopped up the holes as well as we could, to bake the pie in,
and took it down cellar and stole it full of flour and started
for breakfast, and found a couple of shingle-nails that Tom said
would be handy for a prisoner to scrabble his name and sorrows on
the dungeon walls with, and dropped one of them in Aunt Sally's
apron-pocket which was hanging on a chair, and t'other we stuck
in the band of Uncle Silas's hat, which was on the bureau,
because we heard the children say their pa and ma was going to
the runaway nigger's house this morning, and then went to
breakfast, and Tom dropped the pewter spoon in Uncle Silas's
coat-pocket, and Aunt Sally wasn't come yet, so we had to wait a
little while.</p>

<p>And when she come she was hot and red and cross, and couldn't
hardly wait for the blessing; and then she went to sluicing out
coffee with one hand and cracking the handiest child's head with
her thimble with the other, and says:</p>

<p>"I've hunted high and I've hunted low, and it does beat all
what HAS become of your other shirt."</p>

<p>My heart fell down amongst my lungs and livers and things, and
a hard piece of corn-crust started down my throat after it and
got met on the road with a cough, and was shot across the table,
and took one of the children in the eye and curled him up like a
fishing-worm, and let a cry out of him the size of a warwhoop,
and Tom he turned kinder blue around the gills, and it all
amounted to a considerable state of things for about a quarter of
a minute or as much as that, and I would a sold out for half
price if there was a bidder.  But after that we was all right
again&mdash;it was the sudden surprise of it that knocked us so
kind of cold. Uncle Silas he says:</p>

<p>"It's most uncommon curious, I can't understand it.  I know
perfectly well I took it OFF, because&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Because you hain't got but one ON.  Just LISTEN at the man!
 I know you took it off, and know it by a better way than your
wool-gethering memory, too, because it was on the clo's-line
yesterday&mdash;I see it there myself. But it's gone, that's the
long and the short of it, and you'll just have to change to a red
flann'l one till I can get time to make a new one. And it 'll be
the third I've made in two years.  It just keeps a body on the
jump to keep you in shirts; and whatever you do manage to DO with
'm all is more'n I can make out.  A body 'd think you WOULD learn
to take some sort of care of 'em at your time of life."</p>

<p>"I know it, Sally, and I do try all I can.  But it oughtn't to
be altogether my fault, because, you know, I don't see them nor
have nothing to do with them except when they're on me; and I
don't believe I've ever lost one of them OFF of me."</p>

<p>"Well, it ain't YOUR fault if you haven't, Silas; you'd a done
it if you could, I reckon.  And the shirt ain't all that's gone,
nuther.  Ther's a spoon gone; and THAT ain't all.  There was ten,
and now ther's only nine. The calf got the shirt, I reckon, but
the calf never took the spoon, THAT'S certain."</p>

<p>"Why, what else is gone, Sally?"</p>

<p>"Ther's six CANDLES gone&mdash;that's what.  The rats could a
got the candles, and I reckon they did; I wonder they don't walk
off with the whole place, the way you're always going to stop
their holes and don't do it; and if they warn't fools they'd
sleep in your hair, Silas&mdash;YOU'D never find it out; but you
can't lay the SPOON on the rats, and that I know."</p>

<p>"Well, Sally, I'm in fault, and I acknowledge it; I've been
remiss; but I won't let to-morrow go by without stopping up them
holes."</p>

<p>"Oh, I wouldn't hurry; next year 'll do.  Matilda Angelina
Araminta PHELPS!"</p>

<p>Whack comes the thimble, and the child snatches her claws out
of the sugar-bowl without fooling around any.  Just then the
nigger woman steps on to the passage, and says:</p>

<p>"Missus, dey's a sheet gone."</p>

<p>"A SHEET gone!  Well, for the land's sake!"</p>

<p>"I'll stop up them holes to-day," says Uncle Silas, looking
sorrowful.</p>

<p>"Oh, DO shet up!&mdash;s'pose the rats took the SHEET?
 WHERE'S it gone, Lize?"</p>

<p>"Clah to goodness I hain't no notion, Miss' Sally.  She wuz on
de clo'sline yistiddy, but she done gone:  she ain' dah no mo'
now."</p>

<p>"I reckon the world IS coming to an end.  I NEVER see the beat
of it in all my born days.  A shirt, and a sheet, and a spoon,
and six can&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Missus," comes a young yaller wench, "dey's a brass
cannelstick miss'n."</p>

<p>"Cler out from here, you hussy, er I'll take a skillet to
ye!"</p>

<p>Well, she was just a-biling.  I begun to lay for a chance; I
reckoned I would sneak out and go for the woods till the weather
moderated.  She kept a-raging right along, running her
insurrection all by herself, and everybody else mighty meek and
quiet; and at last Uncle Silas, looking kind of foolish, fishes
up that spoon out of his pocket.  She stopped, with her mouth
open and her hands up; and as for me, I wished I was in Jeruslem
or somewheres. But not long, because she says:</p>

<p>"It's JUST as I expected.  So you had it in your pocket all
the time; and like as not you've got the other things there, too.
 How'd it get there?"</p>

<p>"I reely don't know, Sally," he says, kind of apologizing, "or
you know I would tell.  I was a-studying over my text in Acts
Seventeen before breakfast, and I reckon I put it in there, not
noticing, meaning to put my Testament in, and it must be so,
because my Testament ain't in; but I'll go and see; and if the
Testament is where I had it, I'll know I didn't put it in, and
that will show that I laid the Testament down and took up the
spoon, and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, for the land's sake!  Give a body a rest!  Go 'long now,
the whole kit and biling of ye; and don't come nigh me again till
I've got back my peace of mind."</p>

<p>I'D a heard her if she'd a said it to herself, let alone
speaking it out; and I'd a got up and obeyed her if I'd a been
dead.  As we was passing through the setting-room the old man he
took up his hat, and the shingle- nail fell out on the floor, and
he just merely picked it up and laid it on the mantel-shelf, and
never said nothing, and went out.  Tom see him do it, and
remembered about the spoon, and says:</p>

<p>"Well, it ain't no use to send things by HIM no more, he ain't
reliable." Then he says:  "But he done us a good turn with the
spoon, anyway, without knowing it, and so we'll go and do him one
without HIM knowing it&mdash;stop up his rat-holes."</p>

<p>There was a noble good lot of them down cellar, and it took us
a whole hour, but we done the job tight and good and shipshape.
 Then we heard steps on the stairs, and blowed out our light and
hid; and here comes the old man, with a candle in one hand and a
bundle of stuff in t'other, looking as absent-minded as year
before last.  He went a mooning around, first to one rat-hole and
then another, till he'd been to them all.  Then he stood about
five minutes, picking tallow-drip off of his candle and thinking.
 Then he turns off slow and dreamy towards the stairs,
saying:</p>

<p>"Well, for the life of me I can't remember when I done it.  I
could show her now that I warn't to blame on account of the rats.
 But never mind&mdash;let it go.  I reckon it wouldn't do no
good."</p>

<p>And so he went on a-mumbling up stairs, and then we left.  He
was a mighty nice old man.  And always is.</p>

<p>Tom was a good deal bothered about what to do for a spoon, but
he said we'd got to have it; so he took a think.  When he had
ciphered it out he told me how we was to do; then we went and
waited around the spoon-basket till we see Aunt Sally coming, and
then Tom went to counting the spoons and laying them out to one
side, and I slid one of them up my sleeve, and Tom says:</p>

<p>"Why, Aunt Sally, there ain't but nine spoons YET."</p>

<p>She says:</p>

<p>"Go 'long to your play, and don't bother me.  I know better, I
counted 'm myself."</p>

<p>"Well, I've counted them twice, Aunty, and I can't make but
nine."</p>

<p>She looked out of all patience, but of course she come to
count&mdash;anybody would.</p>

<p>"I declare to gracious ther' AIN'T but nine!" she says.  "Why,
what in the world&mdash;plague TAKE the things, I'll count 'm
again."</p>

<p>So I slipped back the one I had, and when she got done
counting, she says:</p>

<p>"Hang the troublesome rubbage, ther's TEN now!" and she looked
huffy and bothered both.  But Tom says:</p>

<p>"Why, Aunty, I don't think there's ten."</p>

<p>"You numskull, didn't you see me COUNT 'm?"</p>

<p>"I know, but&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Well, I'll count 'm AGAIN."</p>

<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

<p>So I smouched one, and they come out nine, same as the other
time.  Well, she WAS in a tearing way&mdash;just a-trembling all
over, she was so mad.  But she counted and counted till she got
that addled she'd start to count in the basket for a spoon
sometimes; and so, three times they come out right, and three
times they come out wrong.  Then she grabbed up the basket and
slammed it across the house and knocked the cat galley-west; and
she said cle'r out and let her have some peace, and if we come
bothering around her again betwixt that and dinner she'd skin us.
 So we had the odd spoon, and dropped it in her apron-pocket
whilst she was a- giving us our sailing orders, and Jim got it
all right, along with her shingle nail, before noon.  We was very
well satisfied with this business, and Tom allowed it was worth
twice the trouble it took, because he said NOW she couldn't ever
count them spoons twice alike again to save her life; and
wouldn't believe she'd counted them right if she DID; and said
that after she'd about counted her head off for the next three
days he judged she'd give it up and offer to kill anybody that
wanted her to ever count them any more.</p>

<p>So we put the sheet back on the line that night, and stole one
out of her closet; and kept on putting it back and stealing it
again for a couple of days till she didn't know how many sheets
she had any more, and she didn't CARE, and warn't a-going to
bullyrag the rest of her soul out about it, and wouldn't count
them again not to save her life; she druther die first.</p>

<p>So we was all right now, as to the shirt and the sheet and the
spoon and the candles, by the help of the calf and the rats and
the mixed-up counting; and as to the candlestick, it warn't no
consequence, it would blow over by and by.</p>

<p>But that pie was a job; we had no end of trouble with that
pie.  We fixed it up away down in the woods, and cooked it there;
and we got it done at last, and very satisfactory, too; but not
all in one day; and we had to use up three wash-pans full of
flour before we got through, and we got burnt pretty much all
over, in places, and eyes put out with the smoke; because, you
see, we didn't want nothing but a crust, and we couldn't prop it
up right, and she would always cave in.  But of course we thought
of the right way at last&mdash;which was to cook the ladder, too,
in the pie.  So then we laid in with Jim the second night, and
tore up the sheet all in little strings and twisted them
together, and long before daylight we had a lovely rope that you
could a hung a person with.  We let on it took nine months to
make it.</p>

<p>And in the forenoon we took it down to the woods, but it
wouldn't go into the pie.  Being made of a whole sheet, that way,
there was rope enough for forty pies if we'd a wanted them, and
plenty left over for soup, or sausage, or anything you choose.
 We could a had a whole dinner.</p>

<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

<p>But we didn't need it.  All we needed was just enough for the
pie, and so we throwed the rest away.  We didn't cook none of the
pies in the wash- pan&mdash;afraid the solder would melt; but
Uncle Silas he had a noble brass warming-pan which he thought
considerable of, because it belonged to one of his ancesters with
a long wooden handle that come over from England with William the
Conqueror in the Mayflower or one of them early ships and was hid
away up garret with a lot of other old pots and things that was
valuable, not on account of being any account, because they
warn't, but on account of them being relicts, you know, and we
snaked her out, private, and took her down there, but she failed
on the first pies, because we didn't know how, but she come up
smiling on the last one.  We took and lined her with dough, and
set her in the coals, and loaded her up with rag rope, and put on
a dough roof, and shut down the lid, and put hot embers on top,
and stood off five foot, with the long handle, cool and
comfortable, and in fifteen minutes she turned out a pie that was
a satisfaction to look at. But the person that et it would want
to fetch a couple of kags of toothpicks along, for if that rope
ladder wouldn't cramp him down to business I don't know nothing
what I'm talking about, and lay him in enough stomach-ache to
last him till next time, too.</p>

<p>Nat didn't look when we put the witch pie in Jim's pan; and we
put the three tin plates in the bottom of the pan under the
vittles; and so Jim got everything all right, and as soon as he
was by himself he busted into the pie and hid the rope ladder
inside of his straw tick, and scratched some marks on a tin plate
and throwed it out of the window-hole.</p>

CHAPTER XXXVIII.</p>

<p>MAKING them pens was a distressid tough job, and so was the
saw; and Jim allowed the inscription was going to be the toughest
of all.  That's the one which the prisoner has to scrabble on the
wall.  But he had to have it; Tom said he'd GOT to; there warn't
no case of a state prisoner not scrabbling his inscription to
leave behind, and his coat of arms.</p>

<p>"Look at Lady Jane Grey," he says; "look at Gilford Dudley;
look at old Northumberland!  Why, Huck, s'pose it IS considerble
trouble?&mdash;what you going to do?&mdash;how you going to get
around it?  Jim's GOT to do his inscription and coat of arms.
 They all do."</p>

<p>Jim says:</p>

<p>"Why, Mars Tom, I hain't got no coat o' arm; I hain't got
nuffn but dish yer ole shirt, en you knows I got to keep de
journal on dat."</p>

<p>"Oh, you don't understand, Jim; a coat of arms is very
different."</p>

<p>"Well," I says, "Jim's right, anyway, when he says he ain't
got no coat of arms, because he hain't."</p>

<p>"I reckon I knowed that," Tom says, "but you bet he'll have
one before he goes out of this&mdash;because he's going out
RIGHT, and there ain't going to be no flaws in his record."</p>

<p>So whilst me and Jim filed away at the pens on a brickbat
apiece, Jim a- making his'n out of the brass and I making mine
out of the spoon, Tom set to work to think out the coat of arms.
 By and by he said he'd struck so many good ones he didn't hardly
know which to take, but there was one which he reckoned he'd
decide on.  He says:</p>

<p>"On the scutcheon we'll have a bend OR in the dexter base, a
saltire MURREY in the fess, with a dog, couchant, for common
charge, and under his foot a chain embattled, for slavery, with a
chevron VERT in a chief engrailed, and three invected lines on a
field AZURE, with the nombril points rampant on a dancette
indented; crest, a runaway nigger, SABLE, with his bundle over
his shoulder on a bar sinister; and a couple of gules for
supporters, which is you and me; motto, MAGGIORE FRETTA, MINORE
OTTO.  Got it out of a book&mdash;means the more haste the less
speed."</p>

<p>"Geewhillikins," I says, "but what does the rest of it
mean?"</p>

<p>"We ain't got no time to bother over that," he says; "we got
to dig in like all git-out."</p>

<p>"Well, anyway," I says, "what's SOME of it?  What's a
fess?"</p>

<p>"A fess&mdash;a fess is&mdash;YOU don't need to know what a
fess is.  I'll show him how to make it when he gets to it."</p>

<p>"Shucks, Tom," I says, "I think you might tell a person.
 What's a bar sinister?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I don't know.  But he's got to have it.  All the nobility
does."</p>

<p>That was just his way.  If it didn't suit him to explain a
thing to you, he wouldn't do it.  You might pump at him a week,
it wouldn't make no difference.</p>

<p>He'd got all that coat of arms business fixed, so now he
started in to finish up the rest of that part of the work, which
was to plan out a mournful inscription&mdash;said Jim got to have
one, like they all done.  He made up a lot, and wrote them out on
a paper, and read them off, so:</p>

<p>1.  Here a captive heart busted. 2.  Here a poor prisoner,
forsook by the world and friends, fretted his sorrowful life. 3.
 Here a lonely heart broke, and a worn spirit went to its rest,
after thirty-seven years of solitary captivity. 4.  Here,
homeless and friendless, after thirty-seven years of bitter
captivity, perished a noble stranger, natural son of Louis
XIV.</p>

<p>Tom's voice trembled whilst he was reading them, and he most
broke down. When he got done he couldn't no way make up his mind
which one for Jim to scrabble on to the wall, they was all so
good; but at last he allowed he would let him scrabble them all
on.  Jim said it would take him a year to scrabble such a lot of
truck on to the logs with a nail, and he didn't know how to make
letters, besides; but Tom said he would block them out for him,
and then he wouldn't have nothing to do but just follow the
lines.  Then pretty soon he says:</p>

<p>"Come to think, the logs ain't a-going to do; they don't have
log walls in a dungeon:  we got to dig the inscriptions into a
rock.  We'll fetch a rock."</p>

<p>Jim said the rock was worse than the logs; he said it would
take him such a pison long time to dig them into a rock he
wouldn't ever get out.  But Tom said he would let me help him do
it.  Then he took a look to see how me and Jim was getting along
with the pens.  It was most pesky tedious hard work and slow, and
didn't give my hands no show to get well of the sores, and we
didn't seem to make no headway, hardly; so Tom says:</p>

<p>"I know how to fix it.  We got to have a rock for the coat of
arms and mournful inscriptions, and we can kill two birds with
that same rock. There's a gaudy big grindstone down at the mill,
and we'll smouch it, and carve the things on it, and file out the
pens and the saw on it, too."</p>

<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

<p>It warn't no slouch of an idea; and it warn't no slouch of a
grindstone nuther; but we allowed we'd tackle it.  It warn't
quite midnight yet, so we cleared out for the mill, leaving Jim
at work.  We smouched the grindstone, and set out to roll her
home, but it was a most nation tough job. Sometimes, do what we
could, we couldn't keep her from falling over, and she come
mighty near mashing us every time.  Tom said she was going to get
one of us, sure, before we got through.  We got her half way; and
then we was plumb played out, and most drownded with sweat.  We
see it warn't no use; we got to go and fetch Jim. So he raised up
his bed and slid the chain off of the bed-leg, and wrapt it round
and round his neck, and we crawled out through our hole and down
there, and Jim and me laid into that grindstone and walked her
along like nothing; and Tom superintended.  He could
out-superintend any boy I ever see.  He knowed how to do
everything.</p>

<p>Our hole was pretty big, but it warn't big enough to get the
grindstone through; but Jim he took the pick and soon made it big
enough.  Then Tom marked out them things on it with the nail, and
set Jim to work on them, with the nail for a chisel and an iron
bolt from the rubbage in the lean- to for a hammer, and told him
to work till the rest of his candle quit on him, and then he
could go to bed, and hide the grindstone under his straw tick and
sleep on it.  Then we helped him fix his chain back on the
bed-leg, and was ready for bed ourselves.  But Tom thought of
something, and says:</p>

<p>"You got any spiders in here, Jim?"</p>

<p>"No, sah, thanks to goodness I hain't, Mars Tom."</p>

<p>"All right, we'll get you some."</p>

<p>"But bless you, honey, I doan' WANT none.  I's afeard un um.
 I jis' 's soon have rattlesnakes aroun'."</p>

<p>Tom thought a minute or two, and says:</p>

<p>"It's a good idea.  And I reckon it's been done.  It MUST a
been done; it stands to reason.  Yes, it's a prime good idea.
 Where could you keep it?"</p>

<p>"Keep what, Mars Tom?"</p>

<p>"Why, a rattlesnake."</p>

<p>"De goodness gracious alive, Mars Tom!  Why, if dey was a
rattlesnake to come in heah I'd take en bust right out thoo dat
log wall, I would, wid my head."</p>

<p>"Why, Jim, you wouldn't be afraid of it after a little.  You
could tame it."</p>

<p>"TAME it!"</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;easy enough.  Every animal is grateful for kindness
and petting, and they wouldn't THINK of hurting a person that
pets them.  Any book will tell you that.  You try&mdash;that's
all I ask; just try for two or three days. Why, you can get him
so, in a little while, that he'll love you; and sleep with you; and
won't stay away from you a minute; and will let you wrap him
round your neck and put his head in your mouth."</p>

<p>"PLEASE, Mars Tom&mdash;DOAN' talk so!  I can't STAN' it!
 He'd LET me shove his head in my mouf&mdash;fer a favor, hain't
it?  I lay he'd wait a pow'ful long time 'fo' I AST him.  En mo'
en dat, I doan' WANT him to sleep wid me."</p>

<p>"Jim, don't act so foolish.  A prisoner's GOT to have some
kind of a dumb pet, and if a rattlesnake hain't ever been tried,
why, there's more glory to be gained in your being the first to
ever try it than any other way you could ever think of to save
your life."</p>

<p>"Why, Mars Tom, I doan' WANT no sich glory.  Snake take 'n
bite Jim's chin off, den WHAH is de glory?  No, sah, I doan' want
no sich doin's."</p>

<p>"Blame it, can't you TRY?  I only WANT you to try&mdash;you
needn't keep it up if it don't work."</p>

<p>"But de trouble all DONE ef de snake bite me while I's a
tryin' him. Mars Tom, I's willin' to tackle mos' anything 'at
ain't onreasonable, but ef you en Huck fetches a rattlesnake in
heah for me to tame, I's gwyne to LEAVE, dat's SHORE."</p>

<p>"Well, then, let it go, let it go, if you're so bull-headed
about it.  We can get you some garter-snakes, and you can tie
some buttons on their tails, and let on they're rattlesnakes, and
I reckon that 'll have to do."</p>

<p>"I k'n stan' DEM, Mars Tom, but blame' 'f I couldn' get along
widout um, I tell you dat.  I never knowed b'fo' 't was so much
bother and trouble to be a prisoner."</p>

<p>"Well, it ALWAYS is when it's done right.  You got any rats
around here?"</p>

<p>"No, sah, I hain't seed none."</p>

<p>"Well, we'll get you some rats."</p>

<p>"Why, Mars Tom, I doan' WANT no rats.  Dey's de dadblamedest
creturs to 'sturb a body, en rustle roun' over 'im, en bite his
feet, when he's tryin' to sleep, I ever see.  No, sah, gimme
g'yarter-snakes, 'f I's got to have 'm, but doan' gimme no rats;
I hain' got no use f'r um, skasely."</p>

<p>"But, Jim, you GOT to have 'em&mdash;they all do.  So don't
make no more fuss about it.  Prisoners ain't ever without rats.
 There ain't no instance of it.  And they train them, and pet
them, and learn them tricks, and they get to be as sociable as
flies.  But you got to play music to them.  You got anything to
play music on?"</p>

<p>"I ain' got nuffn but a coase comb en a piece o' paper, en a
juice-harp; but I reck'n dey wouldn' take no stock in a
juice-harp."</p>

<p>"Yes they would.  THEY don't care what kind of music 'tis.  A
jews-harp's plenty good enough for a rat.  All animals like
music&mdash;in a prison they dote on it.  Specially, painful
music; and you can't get no other kind out of a jews-harp.  It
always interests them; they come out to see what's the matter
with you.  Yes, you're all right; you're fixed very well.  You
want to set on your bed nights before you go to sleep, and early
in the mornings, and play your jews-harp; play 'The Last Link is
Broken'&mdash;that's the thing that 'll scoop a rat quicker 'n
anything else; and when you've played about two minutes you'll
see all the rats, and the snakes, and spiders, and things begin
to feel worried about you, and come.  And they'll just fairly
swarm over you, and have a noble good time."</p>

<p>"Yes, DEY will, I reck'n, Mars Tom, but what kine er time is
JIM havin'? Blest if I kin see de pint.  But I'll do it ef I got
to.  I reck'n I better keep de animals satisfied, en not have no
trouble in de house."</p>

<p>Tom waited to think it over, and see if there wasn't nothing
else; and pretty soon he says:</p>

<p>"Oh, there's one thing I forgot.  Could you raise a flower
here, do you reckon?"</p>

<p>"I doan know but maybe I could, Mars Tom; but it's tolable
dark in heah, en I ain' got no use f'r no flower, nohow, en she'd
be a pow'ful sight o' trouble."</p>

<p>"Well, you try it, anyway.  Some other prisoners has done
it."</p>

<p>"One er dem big cat-tail-lookin' mullen-stalks would grow in
heah, Mars Tom, I reck'n, but she wouldn't be wuth half de
trouble she'd coss."</p>

<p>"Don't you believe it.  We'll fetch you a little one and you
plant it in the corner over there, and raise it.  And don't call
it mullen, call it Pitchiola&mdash;that's its right name when
it's in a prison.  And you want to water it with your tears."</p>

<p>"Why, I got plenty spring water, Mars Tom."</p>

<p>"You don't WANT spring water; you want to water it with your
tears.  It's the way they always do."</p>

<p>"Why, Mars Tom, I lay I kin raise one er dem mullen-stalks
twyste wid spring water whiles another man's a START'N one wid
tears."</p>

<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

<p>"That ain't the idea.  You GOT to do it with tears."</p>

<p>"She'll die on my han's, Mars Tom, she sholy will; kase I
doan' skasely ever cry."</p>

<p>So Tom was stumped.  But he studied it over, and then said Jim
would have to worry along the best he could with an onion.  He
promised he would go to the nigger cabins and drop one, private,
in Jim's coffee-pot, in the morning. Jim said he would "jis' 's
soon have tobacker in his coffee;" and found so much fault with
it, and with the work and bother of raising the mullen, and
jews-harping the rats, and petting and flattering up the snakes
and spiders and things, on top of all the other work he had to do
on pens, and inscriptions, and journals, and things, which made
it more trouble and worry and responsibility to be a prisoner
than anything he ever undertook, that Tom most lost all patience
with him; and said he was just loadened down with more gaudier
chances than a prisoner ever had in the world to make a name for
himself, and yet he didn't know enough to appreciate them, and
they was just about wasted on him.  So Jim he was sorry, and said
he wouldn't behave so no more, and then me and Tom shoved for
bed.</p>

CHAPTER XXXIX.</p>

<p>IN the morning we went up to the village and bought a wire
rat-trap and fetched it down, and unstopped the best rat-hole,
and in about an hour we had fifteen of the bulliest kind of ones;
and then we took it and put it in a safe place under Aunt Sally's
bed.  But while we was gone for spiders little Thomas Franklin
Benjamin Jefferson Elexander Phelps found it there, and opened
the door of it to see if the rats would come out, and they did;
and Aunt Sally she come in, and when we got back she was
a-standing on top of the bed raising Cain, and the rats was doing
what they could to keep off the dull times for her.  So she took
and dusted us both with the hickry, and we was as much as two
hours catching another fifteen or sixteen, drat that meddlesome
cub, and they warn't the likeliest, nuther, because the first
haul was the pick of the flock.  I never see a likelier lot of
rats than what that first haul was.</p>

<p>We got a splendid stock of sorted spiders, and bugs, and
frogs, and caterpillars, and one thing or another; and we like to
got a hornet's nest, but we didn't.  The family was at home.  We
didn't give it right up, but stayed with them as long as we
could; because we allowed we'd tire them out or they'd got to
tire us out, and they done it.  Then we got allycumpain and
rubbed on the places, and was pretty near all right again, but
couldn't set down convenient.  And so we went for the snakes, and
grabbed a couple of dozen garters and house-snakes, and put them
in a bag, and put it in our room, and by that time it was
supper-time, and a rattling good honest day's work:  and
hungry?&mdash;oh, no, I reckon not!  And there warn't a blessed
snake up there when we went back&mdash;we didn't half tie the
sack, and they worked out somehow, and left.  But it didn't
matter much, because they was still on the premises somewheres.
 So we judged we could get some of them again.  No, there warn't
no real scarcity of snakes about the house for a considerable
spell.  You'd see them dripping from the rafters and places every
now and then; and they generly landed in your plate, or down the
back of your neck, and most of the time where you didn't want
them.  Well, they was handsome and striped, and there warn't no
harm in a million of them; but that never made no difference to
Aunt Sally; she despised snakes, be the breed what they might,
and she couldn't stand them no way you could fix it; and every
time one of them flopped down on her, it didn't make no
difference what she was doing, she would just lay that work down
and light out.  I never see such a woman.  And you could hear her
whoop to Jericho.  You couldn't get her to take a-holt of one of
them with the tongs.  And if she turned over and found one in bed
she would scramble out and lift a howl that you would think the
house was afire.  She disturbed the old man so that he said he
could most wish there hadn't ever been no snakes created.  Why,
after every last snake had been gone clear out of the house for
as much as a week Aunt Sally warn't over it yet; she warn't near
over it; when she was setting thinking about something you could
touch her on the back of her neck with a feather and she would
jump right out of her stockings.  It was very curious.  But Tom
said all women was just so.  He said they was made that way for
some reason or other.</p>

<p>We got a licking every time one of our snakes come in her way,
and she allowed these lickings warn't nothing to what she would
do if we ever loaded up the place again with them.  I didn't mind
the lickings, because they didn't amount to nothing; but I minded
the trouble we had to lay in another lot.  But we got them laid
in, and all the other things; and you never see a cabin as
blithesome as Jim's was when they'd all swarm out for music and
go for him.  Jim didn't like the spiders, and the spiders didn't
like Jim; and so they'd lay for him, and make it mighty warm for
him.  And he said that between the rats and the snakes and the
grindstone there warn't no room in bed for him, skasely; and when
there was, a body couldn't sleep, it was so lively, and it was
always lively, he said, because THEY never all slept at one time,
but took turn about, so when the snakes was asleep the rats was
on deck, and when the rats turned in the snakes come on watch, so
he always had one gang under him, in his way, and t'other gang
having a circus over him, and if he got up to hunt a new place
the spiders would take a chance at him as he crossed over. He
said if he ever got out this time he wouldn't ever be a prisoner
again, not for a salary.</p>

<p>Well, by the end of three weeks everything was in pretty good
shape.  The shirt was sent in early, in a pie, and every time a
rat bit Jim he would get up and write a little in his journal
whilst the ink was fresh; the pens was made, the inscriptions and
so on was all carved on the grindstone; the bed-leg was sawed in
two, and we had et up the sawdust, and it give us a most amazing
stomach-ache.  We reckoned we was all going to die, but didn't.
 It was the most undigestible sawdust I ever see; and Tom said
the same./<p>

<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

<p>But as I was saying, we'd got all the work done now,
at last; and we was all pretty much fagged out, too, but mainly
Jim.  The old man had wrote a couple of times to the plantation
below Orleans to come and get their runaway nigger, but hadn't
got no answer, because there warn't no such plantation; so he
allowed he would advertise Jim in the St. Louis and New Orleans
papers; and when he mentioned the St. Louis ones it give me the
cold shivers, and I see we hadn't no time to lose. So Tom said,
now for the nonnamous letters.</p>

<p>"What's them?"  I says.</p>

<p>"Warnings to the people that something is up.  Sometimes it's
done one way, sometimes another.  But there's always somebody
spying around that gives notice to the governor of the castle.
 When Louis XVI. was going to light out of the Tooleries, a
servant-girl done it.  It's a very good way, and so is the
nonnamous letters.  We'll use them both.  And it's usual for the
prisoner's mother to change clothes with him, and she stays in,
and he slides out in her clothes.  We'll do that, too."</p>

<p>"But looky here, Tom, what do we want to WARN anybody for that
something's up?  Let them find it out for themselves&mdash;it's
their lookout."</p>

<p>"Yes, I know; but you can't depend on them.  It's the way
they've acted from the very start&mdash;left us to do EVERYTHING.
 They're so confiding and mullet-headed they don't take notice of
nothing at all.  So if we don't GIVE them notice there won't be
nobody nor nothing to interfere with us, and so after all our
hard work and trouble this escape 'll go off perfectly flat;
won't amount to nothing&mdash;won't be nothing TO it."</p>

<p>"Well, as for me, Tom, that's the way I'd like."</p>

<p>"Shucks!" he says, and looked disgusted.  So I says:</p>

<p>"But I ain't going to make no complaint.  Any way that suits
you suits me. What you going to do about the servant-girl?"</p>

<p>"You'll be her.  You slide in, in the middle of the night, and
hook that yaller girl's frock."</p>

<p>"Why, Tom, that 'll make trouble next morning; because, of
course, she prob'bly hain't got any but that one."</p>

<p>"I know; but you don't want it but fifteen minutes, to carry
the nonnamous letter and shove it under the front door."</p>

<p>"All right, then, I'll do it; but I could carry it just as
handy in my own togs."</p>

<p>"You wouldn't look like a servant-girl THEN, would you?"</p>

<p>"No, but there won't be nobody to see what I look like,
ANYWAY."</p>

<p>"That ain't got nothing to do with it.  The thing for us to do
is just to do our DUTY, and not worry about whether anybody SEES
us do it or not. Hain't you got no principle at all?"</p>

<p>"All right, I ain't saying nothing; I'm the servant-girl.
 Who's Jim's mother?"</p>

<p>"I'm his mother.  I'll hook a gown from Aunt Sally."</p>

<p>"Well, then, you'll have to stay in the cabin when me and Jim
leaves."</p>

<p>"Not much.  I'll stuff Jim's clothes full of straw and lay it
on his bed to represent his mother in disguise, and Jim 'll take
the nigger woman's gown off of me and wear it, and we'll all
evade together.  When a prisoner of style escapes it's called an
evasion.  It's always called so when a king escapes, f'rinstance.
 And the same with a king's son; it don't make no difference
whether he's a natural one or an unnatural one."</p>

<p>So Tom he wrote the nonnamous letter, and I smouched the
yaller wench's frock that night, and put it on, and shoved it
under the front door, the way Tom told me to.  It said:</p>

<p>Beware.  Trouble is brewing.  Keep a sharp lookout. UNKNOWN
FRIEND.</p>

<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>


<p>Next night we stuck a picture, which Tom drawed in blood, of a
skull and crossbones on the front door; and next night another
one of a coffin on the back door.  I never see a family in such a
sweat.  They couldn't a been worse scared if the place had a been
full of ghosts laying for them behind everything and under the
beds and shivering through the air.  If a door banged, Aunt Sally
she jumped and said "ouch!" if anything fell, she jumped and said
"ouch!" if you happened to touch her, when she warn't noticing,
she done the same; she couldn't face noway and be satisfied,
because she allowed there was something behind her every
time&mdash;so she was always a-whirling around sudden, and saying
"ouch," and before she'd got two-thirds around she'd whirl back
again, and say it again; and she was afraid to go to bed, but she
dasn't set up.  So the thing was working very well, Tom said; he
said he never see a thing work more satisfactory. He said it
showed it was done right.</p>

<p>So he said, now for the grand bulge!  So the very next morning
at the streak of dawn we got another letter ready, and was
wondering what we better do with it, because we heard them say at
supper they was going to have a nigger on watch at both doors all
night.  Tom he went down the lightning-rod to spy around; and the
nigger at the back door was asleep, and he stuck it in the back
of his neck and come back.  This letter said:</p>

<p>Don't betray me, I wish to be your friend.  There is a
desprate gang of cutthroats from over in the Indian Territory
going to steal your runaway nigger to-night, and they have been
trying to scare you so as you will stay in the house and not
bother them.  I am one of the gang, but have got religgion and
wish to quit it and lead an honest life again, and will betray
the helish design. They will sneak down from northards, along the
fence, at midnight exact, with a false key, and go in the
nigger's cabin to get him. I am to be off a piece and blow a tin
horn if I see any danger; but stead of that I will BA like a
sheep soon as they get in and not blow at all; then whilst they
are getting his chains loose, you slip there and lock them in,
and can kill them at your leasure.  Don't do anything but just
the way I am telling you, if you do they will suspicion something
and raise whoop-jamboreehoo. I do not wish any reward but to know
I have done the right thing. UNKNOWN FRIEND.</p>

CHAPTER XL.</p>

<p>WE was feeling pretty good after breakfast, and took my canoe
and went over the river a-fishing, with a lunch, and had a good
time, and took a look at the raft and found her all right, and
got home late to supper, and found them in such a sweat and worry
they didn't know which end they was standing on, and made us go
right off to bed the minute we was done supper, and wouldn't tell
us what the trouble was, and never let on a word about the new
letter, but didn't need to, because we knowed as much about it as
anybody did, and as soon as we was half up stairs and her back
was turned we slid for the cellar cupboard and loaded up a good
lunch and took it up to our room and went to bed, and got up
about half- past eleven, and Tom put on Aunt Sally's dress that
he stole and was going to start with the lunch, but says:</p>

<p>"Where's the butter?"</p>

<p>"I laid out a hunk of it," I says, "on a piece of a
corn-pone."</p>

<p>"Well, you LEFT it laid out, then&mdash;it ain't here."</p>

<p>"We can get along without it," I says.</p>

<p>"We can get along WITH it, too," he says; "just you slide down
cellar and fetch it.  And then mosey right down the lightning-rod
and come along. I'll go and stuff the straw into Jim's clothes to
represent his mother in disguise, and be ready to BA like a sheep
and shove soon as you get there."</p>

<p>So out he went, and down cellar went I. The hunk of butter,
big as a person's fist, was where I had left it, so I took up the
slab of corn- pone with it on, and blowed out my light, and
started up stairs very stealthy, and got up to the main floor all
right, but here comes Aunt Sally with a candle, and I clapped the
truck in my hat, and clapped my hat on my head, and the next
second she see me; and she says:</p>

<p>"You been down cellar?"</p>

<p>"Yes'm."</p>

<p>"What you been doing down there?"</p>

<p>"Noth'n."</p>

<p>"NOTH'N!"</p>

<p>"No'm."</p>

<p>"Well, then, what possessed you to go down there this time of
night?"</p>

<p>"I don't know 'm."</p>

<p>"You don't KNOW?  Don't answer me that way. Tom, I want to
know what you been DOING down there."</p>

<p>"I hain't been doing a single thing, Aunt Sally, I hope to
gracious if I have."</p>

<p>I reckoned she'd let me go now, and as a generl thing she
would; but I s'pose there was so many strange things going on she
was just in a sweat about every little thing that warn't
yard-stick straight; so she says, very decided:</p>

<p>"You just march into that setting-room and stay there till I
come.  You been up to something you no business to, and I lay
I'll find out what it is before I'M done with you."</p>

<p>So she went away as I opened the door and walked into the
setting-room. My, but there was a crowd there!  Fifteen farmers,
and every one of them had a gun.  I was most powerful sick, and
slunk to a chair and set down. They was setting around, some of
them talking a little, in a low voice, and all of them fidgety
and uneasy, but trying to look like they warn't; but I knowed
they was, because they was always taking off their hats, and
putting them on, and scratching their heads, and changing their
seats, and fumbling with their buttons.  I warn't easy myself,
but I didn't take my hat off, all the same.</p>

</center>

<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

<p>I did wish Aunt Sally would come, and get done with me, and
lick me, if she wanted to, and let me get away and tell Tom how
we'd overdone this thing, and what a thundering hornet's-nest
we'd got ourselves into, so we could stop fooling around straight
off, and clear out with Jim before these rips got out of patience
and come for us.</p>

<p>At last she come and begun to ask me questions, but I COULDN'T
answer them straight, I didn't know which end of me was up;
because these men was in such a fidget now that some was wanting
to start right NOW and lay for them desperadoes, and saying it
warn't but a few minutes to midnight; and others was trying to
get them to hold on and wait for the sheep- signal; and here was
Aunty pegging away at the questions, and me a- shaking all over
and ready to sink down in my tracks I was that scared; and the
place getting hotter and hotter, and the butter beginning to melt
and run down my neck and behind my ears; and pretty soon, when
one of them says, "I'M for going and getting in the cabin FIRST
and right NOW, and catching them when they come," I most dropped;
and a streak of butter come a-trickling down my forehead, and
Aunt Sally she see it, and turns white as a sheet, and says:</p>

<p>"For the land's sake, what IS the matter with the child?  He's
got the brain-fever as shore as you're born, and they're oozing
out!"</p>

<p>And everybody runs to see, and she snatches off my hat, and
out comes the bread and what was left of the butter, and she
grabbed me, and hugged me, and says:</p>

<p>"Oh, what a turn you did give me! and how glad and grateful I
am it ain't no worse; for luck's against us, and it never rains
but it pours, and when I see that truck I thought we'd lost you,
for I knowed by the color and all it was just like your brains
would be if&mdash;Dear, dear, whyd'nt you TELL me that was what
you'd been down there for, I wouldn't a cared.  Now cler out to
bed, and don't lemme see no more of you till morning!"</p>

<p>I was up stairs in a second, and down the lightning-rod in
another one, and shinning through the dark for the lean-to.  I
couldn't hardly get my words out, I was so anxious; but I told
Tom as quick as I could we must jump for it now, and not a minute
to lose&mdash;the house full of men, yonder, with guns!</p>

<p>His eyes just blazed; and he says:</p>

<p>"No!&mdash;is that so?  AIN'T it bully!  Why, Huck, if it was
to do over again, I bet I could fetch two hundred!  If we could
put it off till&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Hurry!  HURRY!"  I says.  "Where's Jim?"</p>

<p>"Right at your elbow; if you reach out your arm you can touch
him.  He's dressed, and everything's ready.  Now we'll slide out
and give the sheep- signal."</p>

<p>But then we heard the tramp of men coming to the door, and
heard them begin to fumble with the pad-lock, and heard a man
say:</p>

<p>"I TOLD you we'd be too soon; they haven't come&mdash;the door
is locked. Here, I'll lock some of you into the cabin, and you
lay for 'em in the dark and kill 'em when they come; and the rest
scatter around a piece, and listen if you can hear 'em
coming."</p>

<p>So in they come, but couldn't see us in the dark, and most
trod on us whilst we was hustling to get under the bed.  But we
got under all right, and out through the hole, swift but
soft&mdash;Jim first, me next, and Tom last, which was according
to Tom's orders.  Now we was in the lean-to, and heard trampings
close by outside.  So we crept to the door, and Tom stopped us
there and put his eye to the crack, but couldn't make out
nothing, it was so dark; and whispered and said he would listen
for the steps to get further, and when he nudged us Jim must
glide out first, and him last.  So he set his ear to the crack
and listened, and listened, and listened, and the steps
a-scraping around out there all the time; and at last he nudged
us, and we slid out, and stooped down, not breathing, and not
making the least noise, and slipped stealthy towards the fence in
Injun file, and got to it all right, and me and Jim over it; but
Tom's britches catched fast on a splinter on the top rail, and
then he hear the steps coming, so he had to pull loose, which
snapped the splinter and made a noise; and as he dropped in our
tracks and started somebody sings out:</p>

<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<a name="c40-343"></a>
<br>
<br>
<center>
<img alt="c40-343.jpg (76K)" src="images/c40-343.jpg" height="563" width="377">
</center>

<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

<p>"Who's that?  Answer, or I'll shoot!"</p>

<p>But we didn't answer; we just unfurled our heels and shoved.
 Then there was a rush, and a BANG, BANG, BANG! and the bullets
fairly whizzed around us! We heard them sing out:</p>

<p>"Here they are!  They've broke for the river!  After 'em,
boys, and turn loose the dogs!"</p>

<p>So here they come, full tilt.  We could hear them because they
wore boots and yelled, but we didn't wear no boots and didn't
yell.  We was in the path to the mill; and when they got pretty
close on to us we dodged into the bush and let them go by, and
then dropped in behind them.  They'd had all the dogs shut up, so
they wouldn't scare off the robbers; but by this time somebody
had let them loose, and here they come, making powwow enough for
a million; but they was our dogs; so we stopped in our tracks
till they catched up; and when they see it warn't nobody but us,
and no excitement to offer them, they only just said howdy, and
tore right ahead towards the shouting and clattering; and then we
up-steam again, and whizzed along after them till we was nearly
to the mill, and then struck up through the bush to where my
canoe was tied, and hopped in and pulled for dear life towards
the middle of the river, but didn't make no more noise than we
was obleeged to. Then we struck out, easy and comfortable, for
the island where my raft was; and we could hear them yelling and
barking at each other all up and down the bank, till we was so
far away the sounds got dim and died out.  And when we stepped on
to the raft I says:</p>

<p>"NOW, old Jim, you're a free man again, and I bet you won't
ever be a slave no more."</p>

<p>"En a mighty good job it wuz, too, Huck.  It 'uz planned
beautiful, en it 'uz done beautiful; en dey ain't NOBODY kin git
up a plan dat's mo' mixed-up en splendid den what dat one
wuz."</p>

<p>We was all glad as we could be, but Tom was the gladdest of
all because he had a bullet in the calf of his leg.</p>

<p>When me and Jim heard that we didn't feel so brash as what we
did before. It was hurting him considerable, and bleeding; so we
laid him in the wigwam and tore up one of the duke's shirts for
to bandage him, but he says:</p>

<p>"Gimme the rags; I can do it myself.  Don't stop now; don't
fool around here, and the evasion booming along so handsome; man
the sweeps, and set her loose!  Boys, we done it
elegant!&mdash;'deed we did.  I wish WE'D a had the handling of
Louis XVI., there wouldn't a been no 'Son of Saint Louis, ascend
to heaven!' wrote down in HIS biography; no, sir, we'd a whooped
him over the BORDER&mdash;that's what we'd a done with
HIM&mdash;and done it just as slick as nothing at all, too.  Man
the sweeps&mdash;man the sweeps!"</p>

<p>But me and Jim was consulting&mdash;and thinking.  And after
we'd thought a minute, I says:</p>

<p>"Say it, Jim."</p>

<p>So he says:</p>

<p>"Well, den, dis is de way it look to me, Huck.  Ef it wuz HIM
dat 'uz bein' sot free, en one er de boys wuz to git shot, would
he say, 'Go on en save me, nemmine 'bout a doctor f'r to save dis
one?'  Is dat like Mars Tom Sawyer?  Would he say dat?  You BET
he wouldn't!  WELL, den, is JIM gywne to say it?  No, sah&mdash;I
doan' budge a step out'n dis place 'dout a DOCTOR, not if it's
forty year!"</p>

<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

<p>I knowed he was white inside, and I reckoned he'd say what he
did say&mdash;so it was all right now, and I told Tom I was
a-going for a doctor.  He raised considerable row about it, but
me and Jim stuck to it and wouldn't budge; so he was for crawling
out and setting the raft loose himself; but we wouldn't let him.
 Then he give us a piece of his mind, but it didn't do no
good.</p>

<p>So when he sees me getting the canoe ready, he says:</p>

<p>"Well, then, if you're bound to go, I'll tell you the way to
do when you get to the village.  Shut the door and blindfold the
doctor tight and fast, and make him swear to be silent as the
grave, and put a purse full of gold in his hand, and then take
and lead him all around the back alleys and everywheres in the
dark, and then fetch him here in the canoe, in a roundabout way
amongst the islands, and search him and take his chalk away from
him, and don't give it back to him till you get him back to the
village, or else he will chalk this raft so he can find it again.
It's the way they all do."</p>

<p>So I said I would, and left, and Jim was to hide in the woods
when he see the doctor coming till he was gone again.</p>

CHAPTER XLI.</p>

<p>THE doctor was an old man; a very nice, kind-looking old man
when I got him up.  I told him me and my brother was over on
Spanish Island hunting yesterday afternoon, and camped on a piece
of a raft we found, and about midnight he must a kicked his gun
in his dreams, for it went off and shot him in the leg, and we
wanted him to go over there and fix it and not say nothing about
it, nor let anybody know, because we wanted to come home this
evening and surprise the folks.</p>

<p>"Who is your folks?" he says.</p>

<p>"The Phelpses, down yonder."</p>

<p>"Oh," he says.  And after a minute, he says:</p>

<p>"How'd you say he got shot?"</p>

<p>"He had a dream," I says, "and it shot him."</p>

<p>"Singular dream," he says.</p>

<p>So he lit up his lantern, and got his saddle-bags, and we
started.  But when he sees the canoe he didn't like the look of
her&mdash;said she was big enough for one, but didn't look pretty
safe for two.  I says:</p>

<p>"Oh, you needn't be afeard, sir, she carried the three of us
easy enough."</p>

<p>"What three?"</p>

<p>"Why, me and Sid, and&mdash;and&mdash;and THE GUNS; that's
what I mean."</p>

<p>"Oh," he says.</p>

<p>But he put his foot on the gunnel and rocked her, and shook
his head, and said he reckoned he'd look around for a bigger one.
 But they was all locked and chained; so he took my canoe, and
said for me to wait till he come back, or I could hunt around
further, or maybe I better go down home and get them ready for
the surprise if I wanted to.  But I said I didn't; so I told him
just how to find the raft, and then he started.</p>

<p>I struck an idea pretty soon.  I says to myself, spos'n he
can't fix that leg just in three shakes of a sheep's tail, as the
saying is? spos'n it takes him three or four days?  What are we
going to do?&mdash;lay around there till he lets the cat out of
the bag?  No, sir; I know what I'LL do.  I'll wait, and when he
comes back if he says he's got to go any more I'll get down
there, too, if I swim; and we'll take and tie him, and keep him,
and shove out down the river; and when Tom's done with him we'll
give him what it's worth, or all we got, and then let him get
ashore.</p>

<p>So then I crept into a lumber-pile to get some sleep; and next
time I waked up the sun was away up over my head!  I shot out and
went for the doctor's house, but they told me he'd gone away in
the night some time or other, and warn't back yet.  Well, thinks
I, that looks powerful bad for Tom, and I'll dig out for the
island right off.  So away I shoved, and turned the corner, and
nearly rammed my head into Uncle Silas's stomach! He says:</p>

<p>"Why, TOM!  Where you been all this time, you rascal?"</p>

<br>
<br>
<br>

<p>"I hain't been nowheres," I says, "only just hunting for the
runaway nigger&mdash;me and Sid."</p>

<p>"Why, where ever did you go?" he says.  "Your aunt's been
mighty uneasy."</p>

<p>"She needn't," I says, "because we was all right.  We followed
the men and the dogs, but they outrun us, and we lost them; but
we thought we heard them on the water, so we got a canoe and took
out after them and crossed over, but couldn't find nothing of
them; so we cruised along up- shore till we got kind of tired and
beat out; and tied up the canoe and went to sleep, and never
waked up till about an hour ago; then we paddled over here to
hear the news, and Sid's at the post-office to see what he can
hear, and I'm a-branching out to get something to eat for us, and
then we're going home."</p>

<p>So then we went to the post-office to get "Sid"; but just as I
suspicioned, he warn't there; so the old man he got a letter out
of the office, and we waited awhile longer, but Sid didn't come;
so the old man said, come along, let Sid foot it home, or canoe
it, when he got done fooling around&mdash;but we would ride.  I
couldn't get him to let me stay and wait for Sid; and he said
there warn't no use in it, and I must come along, and let Aunt
Sally see we was all right.</p>

<p>When we got home Aunt Sally was that glad to see me she
laughed and cried both, and hugged me, and give me one of them
lickings of hern that don't amount to shucks, and said she'd
serve Sid the same when he come.</p>

<p>And the place was plum full of farmers and farmers' wives, to
dinner; and such another clack a body never heard.  Old Mrs.
Hotchkiss was the worst; her tongue was a-going all the time.
 She says:</p>

<p>"Well, Sister Phelps, I've ransacked that-air cabin over, an'
I b'lieve the nigger was crazy.  I says to Sister
Damrell&mdash;didn't I, Sister Damrell?&mdash;s'I, he's crazy,
s'I&mdash;them's the very words I said.  You all hearn me: he's
crazy, s'I; everything shows it, s'I.  Look at that-air
grindstone, s'I; want to tell ME't any cretur 't's in his right
mind 's a goin' to scrabble all them crazy things onto a
grindstone, s'I?  Here sich 'n' sich a person busted his heart;
'n' here so 'n' so pegged along for thirty-seven year, 'n' all
that&mdash;natcherl son o' Louis somebody, 'n' sich everlast'n
rubbage.  He's plumb crazy, s'I; it's what I says in the fust
place, it's what I says in the middle, 'n' it's what I says last
'n' all the time&mdash;the nigger's crazy&mdash;crazy 's
Nebokoodneezer, s'I."</p>

<br>
<br>
<br>

<p>"An' look at that-air ladder made out'n rags, Sister
Hotchkiss," says old Mrs. Damrell; "what in the name o' goodness
COULD he ever want of&mdash;"</p>

<p>"The very words I was a-sayin' no longer ago th'n this minute
to Sister Utterback, 'n' she'll tell you so herself.  Sh-she,
look at that-air rag ladder, sh-she; 'n' s'I, yes, LOOK at it,
s'I&mdash;what COULD he a-wanted of it, s'I.  Sh-she, Sister
Hotchkiss, sh-she&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But how in the nation'd they ever GIT that grindstone IN
there, ANYWAY? 'n' who dug that-air HOLE? 'n' who&mdash;"</p>

<p>"My very WORDS, Brer Penrod!  I was a-sayin'&mdash;pass
that-air sasser o' m'lasses, won't ye?&mdash;I was a-sayin' to
Sister Dunlap, jist this minute, how DID they git that grindstone
in there, s'I.  Without HELP, mind you&mdash;'thout HELP!
 THAT'S wher 'tis.  Don't tell ME, s'I; there WUZ help, s'I; 'n'
ther' wuz a PLENTY help, too, s'I; ther's ben a DOZEN a-helpin'
that nigger, 'n' I lay I'd skin every last nigger on this place
but I'D find out who done it, s'I; 'n' moreover, s'I&mdash;"</p>

<p>"A DOZEN says you!&mdash;FORTY couldn't a done every thing
that's been done. Look at them case-knife saws and things, how
tedious they've been made; look at that bed-leg sawed off with
'm, a week's work for six men; look at that nigger made out'n
straw on the bed; and look at&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You may WELL say it, Brer Hightower!  It's jist as I was
a-sayin' to Brer Phelps, his own self.  S'e, what do YOU think of
it, Sister Hotchkiss, s'e? Think o' what, Brer Phelps, s'I?
 Think o' that bed-leg sawed off that a way, s'e?  THINK of it,
s'I?  I lay it never sawed ITSELF off, s'I&mdash;somebody SAWED
it, s'I; that's my opinion, take it or leave it, it mayn't be no
'count, s'I, but sich as 't is, it's my opinion, s'I, 'n' if any
body k'n start a better one, s'I, let him DO it, s'I, that's all.
 I says to Sister Dunlap, s'I&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Why, dog my cats, they must a ben a house-full o' niggers in
there every night for four weeks to a done all that work, Sister
Phelps.  Look at that shirt&mdash;every last inch of it kivered
over with secret African writ'n done with blood!  Must a ben a
raft uv 'm at it right along, all the time, amost.  Why, I'd give
two dollars to have it read to me; 'n' as for the niggers that
wrote it, I 'low I'd take 'n' lash 'm t'll&mdash;"</p>

<p>"People to HELP him, Brother Marples!  Well, I reckon you'd
THINK so if you'd a been in this house for a while back.  Why,
they've stole everything they could lay their hands on&mdash;and
we a-watching all the time, mind you. They stole that shirt right
off o' the line! and as for that sheet they made the rag ladder
out of, ther' ain't no telling how many times they DIDN'T steal
that; and flour, and candles, and candlesticks, and spoons, and
the old warming-pan, and most a thousand things that I
disremember now, and my new calico dress; and me and Silas and my
Sid and Tom on the constant watch day AND night, as I was
a-telling you, and not a one of us could catch hide nor hair nor
sight nor sound of them; and here at the last minute, lo and
behold you, they slides right in under our noses and fools us,
and not only fools US but the Injun Territory robbers too, and
actuly gets AWAY with that nigger safe and sound, and that with
sixteen men and twenty-two dogs right on their very heels at that
very time!  I tell you, it just bangs anything I ever HEARD of.
Why, SPERITS couldn't a done better and been no smarter. And I
reckon they must a BEEN sperits&mdash;because, YOU know our dogs,
and ther' ain't no better; well, them dogs never even got on the
TRACK of 'm once!  You explain THAT to me if you can!&mdash;ANY
of you!"</p>

<p>"Well, it does beat&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Laws alive, I never&mdash;"</p>

<p>"So help me, I wouldn't a be&mdash;"</p>

<p>"HOUSE-thieves as well as&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Goodnessgracioussakes, I'd a ben afeard to live in sich
a&mdash;"</p>

<p>"'Fraid to LIVE!&mdash;why, I was that scared I dasn't hardly
go to bed, or get up, or lay down, or SET down, Sister Ridgeway.
 Why, they'd steal the very&mdash;why, goodness sakes, you can
guess what kind of a fluster I was in by the time midnight come
last night.  I hope to gracious if I warn't afraid they'd steal
some o' the family!  I was just to that pass I didn't have no
reasoning faculties no more.  It looks foolish enough NOW, in the
daytime; but I says to myself, there's my two poor boys asleep,
'way up stairs in that lonesome room, and I declare to goodness I
was that uneasy 't I crep' up there and locked 'em in!  I DID.
 And anybody would. Because, you know, when you get scared that
way, and it keeps running on, and getting worse and worse all the
time, and your wits gets to addling, and you get to doing all
sorts o' wild things, and by and by you think to yourself, spos'n
I was a boy, and was away up there, and the door ain't locked,
and you&mdash;" She stopped, looking kind of wondering, and then
she turned her head around slow, and when her eye lit on
me&mdash;I got up and took a walk.</p>

<p>Says I to myself, I can explain better how we come to not be
in that room this morning if I go out to one side and study over
it a little.  So I done it.  But I dasn't go fur, or she'd a sent
for me.  And when it was late in the day the people all went, and
then I come in and told her the noise and shooting waked up me
and "Sid," and the door was locked, and we wanted to see the fun,
so we went down the lightning-rod, and both of us got hurt a
little, and we didn't never want to try THAT no more.  And then I
went on and told her all what I told Uncle Silas before; and then
she said she'd forgive us, and maybe it was all right enough
anyway, and about what a body might expect of boys, for all boys
was a pretty harum- scarum lot as fur as she could see; and so,
as long as no harm hadn't come of it, she judged she better put
in her time being grateful we was alive and well and she had us
still, stead of fretting over what was past and done.  So then
she kissed me, and patted me on the head, and dropped into a kind
of a brown study; and pretty soon jumps up, and says:</p>

<p>"Why, lawsamercy, it's most night, and Sid not come yet!  What
HAS become of that boy?"</p>

<p>I see my chance; so I skips up and says:</p>

<p>"I'll run right up to town and get him," I says.</p>

<p>"No you won't," she says.  "You'll stay right wher' you are;
ONE'S enough to be lost at a time.  If he ain't here to supper,
your uncle 'll go."</p>

<p>Well, he warn't there to supper; so right after supper uncle
went.</p>

<p>He come back about ten a little bit uneasy; hadn't run across
Tom's track. Aunt Sally was a good DEAL uneasy; but Uncle Silas
he said there warn't no occasion to be&mdash;boys will be boys,
he said, and you'll see this one turn up in the morning all sound
and right.  So she had to be satisfied.  But she said she'd set
up for him a while anyway, and keep a light burning so he could
see it.</p>

<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

<p>And then when I went up to bed she come up with me and fetched
her candle, and tucked me in, and mothered me so good I felt
mean, and like I couldn't look her in the face; and she set down
on the bed and talked with me a long time, and said what a
splendid boy Sid was, and didn't seem to want to ever stop
talking about him; and kept asking me every now and then if I
reckoned he could a got lost, or hurt, or maybe drownded, and
might be laying at this minute somewheres suffering or dead, and
she not by him to help him, and so the tears would drip down
silent, and I would tell her that Sid was all right, and would be
home in the morning, sure; and she would squeeze my hand, or
maybe kiss me, and tell me to say it again, and keep on saying
it, because it done her good, and she was in so much trouble.
 And when she was going away she looked down in my eyes so steady
and gentle, and says:</p>

<p>"The door ain't going to be locked, Tom, and there's the
window and the rod; but you'll be good, WON'T you?  And you won't
go?  For MY sake."</p>

<p>Laws knows I WANTED to go bad enough to see about Tom, and was
all intending to go; but after that I wouldn't a went, not for
kingdoms.</p>

<p>But she was on my mind and Tom was on my mind, so I slept very
restless. And twice I went down the rod away in the night, and
slipped around front, and see her setting there by her candle in
the window with her eyes towards the road and the tears in them;
and I wished I could do something for her, but I couldn't, only
to swear that I wouldn't never do nothing to grieve her any more.
 And the third time I waked up at dawn, and slid down, and she
was there yet, and her candle was most out, and her old gray head
was resting on her hand, and she was asleep.</p>

CHAPTER XLII.</p>

<p>THE old man was uptown again before breakfast, but couldn't
get no track of Tom; and both of them set at the table thinking,
and not saying nothing, and looking mournful, and their coffee
getting cold, and not eating anything. And by and by the old man
says:</p>

<p>"Did I give you the letter?"</p>

<p>"What letter?"</p>

<p>"The one I got yesterday out of the post-office."</p>

<p>"No, you didn't give me no letter."</p>

<p>"Well, I must a forgot it."</p>

<p>So he rummaged his pockets, and then went off somewheres where
he had laid it down, and fetched it, and give it to her.  She
says:</p>

<p>"Why, it's from St. Petersburg&mdash;it's from Sis."</p>

<p>I allowed another walk would do me good; but I couldn't stir.
 But before she could break it open she dropped it and
run&mdash;for she see something. And so did I. It was Tom Sawyer
on a mattress; and that old doctor; and Jim, in HER calico dress,
with his hands tied behind him; and a lot of people.  I hid the
letter behind the first thing that come handy, and rushed.  She
flung herself at Tom, crying, and says:</p>

<p>"Oh, he's dead, he's dead, I know he's dead!"</p>

<p>And Tom he turned his head a little, and muttered something or
other, which showed he warn't in his right mind; then she flung
up her hands, and says:</p>

<p>"He's alive, thank God!  And that's enough!" and she snatched
a kiss of him, and flew for the house to get the bed ready, and
scattering orders right and left at the niggers and everybody
else, as fast as her tongue could go, every jump of the way.</p>

<p>I followed the men to see what they was going to do with Jim;
and the old doctor and Uncle Silas followed after Tom into the
house.  The men was very huffy, and some of them wanted to hang
Jim for an example to all the other niggers around there, so they
wouldn't be trying to run away like Jim done, and making such a
raft of trouble, and keeping a whole family scared most to death
for days and nights.  But the others said, don't do it, it
wouldn't answer at all; he ain't our nigger, and his owner would
turn up and make us pay for him, sure.  So that cooled them down
a little, because the people that's always the most anxious for
to hang a nigger that hain't done just right is always the very
ones that ain't the most anxious to pay for him when they've got
their satisfaction out of him.</p>

<p>They cussed Jim considerble, though, and give him a cuff or
two side the head once in a while, but Jim never said nothing,
and he never let on to know me, and they took him to the same
cabin, and put his own clothes on him, and chained him again, and
not to no bed-leg this time, but to a big staple drove into the
bottom log, and chained his hands, too, and both legs, and said
he warn't to have nothing but bread and water to eat after this
till his owner come, or he was sold at auction because he didn't
come in a certain length of time, and filled up our hole, and
said a couple of farmers with guns must stand watch around about
the cabin every night, and a bulldog tied to the door in the
daytime; and about this time they was through with the job and
was tapering off with a kind of generl good-bye cussing, and then
the old doctor comes and takes a look, and says:</p>

<p>"Don't be no rougher on him than you're obleeged to, because
he ain't a bad nigger.  When I got to where I found the boy I see
I couldn't cut the bullet out without some help, and he warn't in
no condition for me to leave to go and get help; and he got a
little worse and a little worse, and after a long time he went
out of his head, and wouldn't let me come a-nigh him any more,
and said if I chalked his raft he'd kill me, and no end of wild
foolishness like that, and I see I couldn't do anything at all
with him; so I says, I got to have HELP somehow; and the minute I
says it out crawls this nigger from somewheres and says he'll
help, and he done it, too, and done it very well.  Of course I
judged he must be a runaway nigger, and there I WAS! and there I
had to stick right straight along all the rest of the day and all
night.  It was a fix, I tell you! I had a couple of patients with
the chills, and of course I'd of liked to run up to town and see
them, but I dasn't, because the nigger might get away, and then
I'd be to blame; and yet never a skiff come close enough for me
to hail.  So there I had to stick plumb until daylight this
morning; and I never see a nigger that was a better nuss or
faithfuller, and yet he was risking his freedom to do it, and was
all tired out, too, and I see plain enough he'd been worked main
hard lately.  I liked the nigger for that; I tell you, gentlemen,
a nigger like that is worth a thousand dollars&mdash;and kind
treatment, too.  I had everything I needed, and the boy was doing
as well there as he would a done at home&mdash;better, maybe,
because it was so quiet; but there I WAS, with both of 'm on my
hands, and there I had to stick till about dawn this morning;
then some men in a skiff come by, and as good luck would have it
the nigger was setting by the pallet with his head propped on his
knees sound asleep; so I motioned them in quiet, and they slipped
up on him and grabbed him and tied him before he knowed what he
was about, and we never had no trouble. And the boy being in a
kind of a flighty sleep, too, we muffled the oars and hitched the
raft on, and towed her over very nice and quiet, and the nigger
never made the least row nor said a word from the start.  He
ain't no bad nigger, gentlemen; that's what I think about
him."</p>

<p>"Well, it sounds very good, doctor, I'm obleeged to say."</p>

<p>Then the others softened up a little, too, and I was mighty
thankful to that old doctor for doing Jim that good turn; and I
was glad it was according to my judgment of him, too; because I
thought he had a good heart in him and was a good man the first
time I see him.  Then they all agreed that Jim had acted very
well, and was deserving to have some notice took of it, and
reward.  So every one of them promised, right out and hearty,
that they wouldn't cuss him no more.</p>

<p>Then they come out and locked him up.  I hoped they was going
to say he could have one or two of the chains took off, because
they was rotten heavy, or could have meat and greens with his
bread and water; but they didn't think of it, and I reckoned it
warn't best for me to mix in, but I judged I'd get the doctor's
yarn to Aunt Sally somehow or other as soon as I'd got through
the breakers that was laying just ahead of
me&mdash;explanations, I mean, of how I forgot to mention about Sid being
shot when I was telling how him and me put in that dratted night
paddling around hunting the runaway nigger.</p>

<p>But I had plenty time.  Aunt Sally she stuck to the sick-room
all day and all night, and every time I see Uncle Silas mooning
around I dodged him.</p>

<p>Next morning I heard Tom was a good deal better, and they said
Aunt Sally was gone to get a nap.  So I slips to the sick-room,
and if I found him awake I reckoned we could put up a yarn for
the family that would wash. But he was sleeping, and sleeping
very peaceful, too; and pale, not fire- faced the way he was when
he come.  So I set down and laid for him to wake.  In about half
an hour Aunt Sally comes gliding in, and there I was, up a stump
again!  She motioned me to be still, and set down by me, and
begun to whisper, and said we could all be joyful now, because
all the symptoms was first-rate, and he'd been sleeping like that
for ever so long, and looking better and peacefuller all the
time, and ten to one he'd wake up in his right mind.</p>

<p>So we set there watching, and by and by he stirs a bit, and
opened his eyes very natural, and takes a look, and says:</p>

<p>"Hello!&mdash;why, I'm at HOME!  How's that?  Where's the
raft?"</p>

<p>"It's all right," I says.</p>

<p>"And JIM?"</p>

<p>"The same," I says, but couldn't say it pretty brash.  But he
never noticed, but says:</p>

<p>"Good!  Splendid!  NOW we're all right and safe! Did you tell
Aunty?"</p>

<p>I was going to say yes; but she chipped in and says:  "About
what, Sid?"</p>

<p>"Why, about the way the whole thing was done."</p>

<p>"What whole thing?"</p>

<p>"Why, THE whole thing.  There ain't but one; how we set the
runaway nigger free&mdash;me and Tom."</p>

<p>"Good land!  Set the run&mdash;What IS the child talking
about!  Dear, dear, out of his head again!"</p>

<p>"NO, I ain't out of my HEAD; I know all what I'm talking
about.  We DID set him free&mdash;me and Tom.  We laid out to do
it, and we DONE it.  And we done it elegant, too."  He'd got a
start, and she never checked him up, just set and stared and
stared, and let him clip along, and I see it warn't no use for ME
to put in.  "Why, Aunty, it cost us a power of work&mdash;weeks
of it&mdash;hours and hours, every night, whilst you was all
asleep. And we had to steal candles, and the sheet, and the
shirt, and your dress, and spoons, and tin plates, and
case-knives, and the warming-pan, and the grindstone, and flour,
and just no end of things, and you can't think what work it was
to make the saws, and pens, and inscriptions, and one thing or
another, and you can't think HALF the fun it was.  And we had to
make up the pictures of coffins and things, and nonnamous letters
from the robbers, and get up and down the lightning-rod, and dig
the hole into the cabin, and made the rope ladder and send it in
cooked up in a pie, and send in spoons and things to work with in
your apron pocket&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Mercy sakes!"</p>

<p>"&mdash;and load up the cabin with rats and snakes and so on,
for company for Jim; and then you kept Tom here so long with the
butter in his hat that you come near spiling the whole business,
because the men come before we was out of the cabin, and we had
to rush, and they heard us and let drive at us, and I got my
share, and we dodged out of the path and let them go by, and when
the dogs come they warn't interested in us, but went for the most
noise, and we got our canoe, and made for the raft, and was all
safe, and Jim was a free man, and we done it all by ourselves,
and WASN'T it bully, Aunty!"</p>

<p>"Well, I never heard the likes of it in all my born days!  So
it was YOU, you little rapscallions, that's been making all this
trouble, and turned everybody's wits clean inside out and scared
us all most to death.  I've as good a notion as ever I had in my
life to take it out o' you this very minute.  To think, here I've
been, night after night, a&mdash;YOU just get well once, you
young scamp, and I lay I'll tan the Old Harry out o' both o'
ye!"</p>

<p>But Tom, he WAS so proud and joyful, he just COULDN'T hold in,
and his tongue just WENT it&mdash;she a-chipping in, and spitting
fire all along, and both of them going it at once, like a cat
convention; and she says:</p>

<p>"WELL, you get all the enjoyment you can out of it NOW, for
mind I tell you if I catch you meddling with him
again&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Meddling with WHO?"  Tom says, dropping his smile and looking
surprised.</p>

<p>"With WHO?  Why, the runaway nigger, of course.  Who'd you
reckon?"</p>

<p>Tom looks at me very grave, and says:</p>

<p>"Tom, didn't you just tell me he was all right?  Hasn't he got
away?"</p>

<p>"HIM?" says Aunt Sally; "the runaway nigger?  'Deed he hasn't.
 They've got him back, safe and sound, and he's in that cabin
again, on bread and water, and loaded down with chains, till he's
claimed or sold!"</p>

<br>
<br>


<p>Tom rose square up in bed, with his eye hot, and his nostrils
opening and shutting like gills, and sings out to me:</p>

<p>"They hain't no RIGHT to shut him up!  SHOVE!&mdash;and don't
you lose a minute.  Turn him loose! he ain't no slave; he's as
free as any cretur that walks this earth!"</p>

<p>"What DOES the child mean?"</p>

<p>"I mean every word I SAY, Aunt Sally, and if somebody don't
go, I'LL go. I've knowed him all his life, and so has Tom, there.
 Old Miss Watson died two months ago, and she was ashamed she
ever was going to sell him down the river, and SAID so; and she
set him free in her will."</p>

<p>"Then what on earth did YOU want to set him free for, seeing
he was already free?"</p>

<p>"Well, that IS a question, I must say; and just like women!
 Why, I wanted the ADVENTURE of it; and I'd a waded neck-deep in
blood to&mdash;goodness alive, AUNT POLLY!"</p>

<p>If she warn't standing right there, just inside the door,
looking as sweet and contented as an angel half full of pie, I
wish I may never!</p>

<p>Aunt Sally jumped for her, and most hugged the head off of
her, and cried over her, and I found a good enough place for me
under the bed, for it was getting pretty sultry for us, seemed to
me.  And I peeped out, and in a little while Tom's Aunt Polly
shook herself loose and stood there looking across at Tom over
her spectacles&mdash;kind of grinding him into the earth, you
know.  And then she says:</p>

<p>"Yes, you BETTER turn y'r head away&mdash;I would if I was
you, Tom."</p>

<p>"Oh, deary me!" says Aunt Sally; "IS he changed so?  Why, that
ain't TOM, it's Sid; Tom's&mdash;Tom's&mdash;why, where is Tom?
 He was here a minute ago."</p>

<p>"You mean where's Huck FINN&mdash;that's what you mean!  I
reckon I hain't raised such a scamp as my Tom all these years not
to know him when I SEE him.  That WOULD be a pretty howdy-do.
Come out from under that bed, Huck Finn."</p>

<p>So I done it.  But not feeling brash.</p>

<p>Aunt Sally she was one of the mixed-upest-looking persons I
ever see&mdash;except one, and that was Uncle Silas, when he
come in and they told it all to him.  It kind of made him drunk,
as you may say, and he didn't know nothing at all the rest of the
day, and preached a prayer-meeting sermon that night that gave
him a rattling ruputation, because the oldest man in the world
couldn't a understood it.  So Tom's Aunt Polly, she told all
about who I was, and what; and I had to up and tell how I was in
such a tight place that when Mrs. Phelps took me for Tom
Sawyer&mdash;she chipped in and says, "Oh, go on and call me Aunt
Sally, I'm used to it now, and 'tain't no need to
change"&mdash;that when Aunt Sally took me for Tom Sawyer I had
to stand it&mdash;there warn't no other way, and I knowed he
wouldn't mind, because it would be nuts for him, being a mystery,
and he'd make an adventure out of it, and be perfectly satisfied.
 And so it turned out, and he let on to be Sid, and made things
as soft as he could for me.</p>

<p>And his Aunt Polly she said Tom was right about old Miss
Watson setting Jim free in her will; and so, sure enough, Tom
Sawyer had gone and took all that trouble and bother to set a
free nigger free! and I couldn't ever understand before, until
that minute and that talk, how he COULD help a body set a nigger
free with his bringing-up.</p>

<p>Well, Aunt Polly she said that when Aunt Sally wrote to her
that Tom and SID had come all right and safe, she says to
herself:</p>

<p>"Look at that, now!  I might have expected it, letting him go
off that way without anybody to watch him.  So now I got to go
and trapse all the way down the river, eleven hundred mile, and
find out what that creetur's up to THIS time, as long as I
couldn't seem to get any answer out of you about it."</p>

<p>"Why, I never heard nothing from you," says Aunt Sally.</p>

<p>"Well, I wonder!  Why, I wrote you twice to ask you what you
could mean by Sid being here."</p>

<p>"Well, I never got 'em, Sis."</p>

<p>Aunt Polly she turns around slow and severe, and says:</p>

<p>"You, Tom!"</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;WHAT?" he says, kind of pettish.</p>

<p>"Don t you what ME, you impudent thing&mdash;hand out them
letters."</p>

<p>"THEM letters.  I be bound, if I have to take a-holt of you
I'll&mdash;"</p>

<p>"They're in the trunk.  There, now.  And they're just the same
as they was when I got them out of the office.  I hain't looked
into them, I hain't touched them.  But I knowed they'd make
trouble, and I thought if you warn't in no hurry, I'd&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Well, you DO need skinning, there ain't no mistake about it.
 And I wrote another one to tell you I was coming; and I s'pose
he&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No, it come yesterday; I hain't read it yet, but IT'S all
right, I've got that one."</p>

<p>I wanted to offer to bet two dollars she hadn't, but I
reckoned maybe it was just as safe to not to.  So I never said
nothing.</p>

CHAPTER THE LAST</p>

<p>THE first time I catched Tom private I asked him what was his
idea, time of the evasion?&mdash;what it was he'd planned to do
if the evasion worked all right and he managed to set a nigger
free that was already free before? And he said, what he had
planned in his head from the start, if we got Jim out all safe,
was for us to run him down the river on the raft, and have
adventures plumb to the mouth of the river, and then tell him
about his being free, and take him back up home on a steamboat,
in style, and pay him for his lost time, and write word ahead and
get out all the niggers around, and have them waltz him into town
with a torchlight procession and a brass-band, and then he would
be a hero, and so would we.  But I reckoned it was about as well
the way it was.</p>

<p>We had Jim out of the chains in no time, and when Aunt Polly
and Uncle Silas and Aunt Sally found out how good he helped the
doctor nurse Tom, they made a heap of fuss over him, and fixed
him up prime, and give him all he wanted to eat, and a good time,
and nothing to do.  And we had him up to the sick-room, and had a
high talk; and Tom give Jim forty dollars for being prisoner for
us so patient, and doing it up so good, and Jim was pleased most
to death, and busted out, and says:</p>

<br>
<br>

<img alt="c43-365.jpg (24K)" src="images/c43-365.jpg" height="453" width="299">
</center>

<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>


<p>"DAH, now, Huck, what I tell you?&mdash;what I tell you up dah
on Jackson islan'?  I TOLE you I got a hairy breas', en what's de
sign un it; en I TOLE you I ben rich wunst, en gwineter to be
rich AGIN; en it's come true; en heah she is!  DAH, now! doan'
talk to ME&mdash;signs is SIGNS, mine I tell you; en I knowed
jis' 's well 'at I 'uz gwineter be rich agin as I's a-stannin'
heah dis minute!"</p>

<p>And then Tom he talked along and talked along, and says, le's
all three slide out of here one of these nights and get an
outfit, and go for howling adventures amongst the Injuns, over in
the Territory, for a couple of weeks or two; and I says, all
right, that suits me, but I ain't got no money for to buy the
outfit, and I reckon I couldn't get none from home, because it's
likely pap's been back before now, and got it all away from Judge
Thatcher and drunk it up.</p>

<p>"No, he hain't," Tom says; "it's all there yet&mdash;six
thousand dollars and more; and your pap hain't ever been back
since.  Hadn't when I come away, anyhow."</p>

<p>Jim says, kind of solemn:</p>

<p>"He ain't a-comin' back no mo', Huck."</p>

<p>I says:</p>

<p>"Why, Jim?"</p>

<p>"Nemmine why, Huck&mdash;but he ain't comin' back no mo."</p>

<p>But I kept at him; so at last he says:</p>

<p>"Doan' you 'member de house dat was float'n down de river, en
dey wuz a man in dah, kivered up, en I went in en unkivered him
and didn' let you come in?  Well, den, you kin git yo' money when
you wants it, kase dat wuz him."</p>

<p>Tom's most well now, and got his bullet around his neck on a
watch-guard for a watch, and is always seeing what time it is,
and so there ain't nothing more to write about, and I am rotten
glad of it, because if I'd a knowed what a trouble it was to make
a book I wouldn't a tackled it, and ain't a-going to no more.
 But I reckon I got to light out for the Territory ahead of the
rest, because Aunt Sally she's going to adopt me and sivilize me,
and I can't stand it.  I been there before.</p>

<p>THE END. YOURS TRULY, HUCK FINN.</p>
