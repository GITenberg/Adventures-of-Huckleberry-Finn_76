<p>CHAPTER I.</p>

<p>YOU don't know about me without you have read a book by the
name of The Adventures of Tom Sawyer; but that ain't no matter.
 That book was made by Mr. Mark Twain, and he told the truth,
mainly.  There was things which he stretched, but mainly he told
the truth.  That is nothing.  I never seen anybody but lied one
time or another, without it was Aunt Polly, or the widow, or
maybe Mary.  Aunt Polly&mdash;Tom's Aunt Polly, she is&mdash;and
Mary, and the Widow Douglas is all told about in that book, which
is mostly a true book, with some stretchers, as I said
before.</p>

<p>Now the way that the book winds up is this:  Tom and me found
the money that the robbers hid in the cave, and it made us rich.
 We got six thousand dollars apiece&mdash;all gold.  It was an
awful sight of money when it was piled up.  Well, Judge Thatcher
he took it and put it out at interest, and it fetched us a dollar
a day apiece all the year round&mdash;more than a body could
tell what to do with.  The Widow Douglas she took me for her son,
and allowed she would sivilize me; but it was rough living in the
house all the time, considering how dismal regular and decent the
widow was in all her ways; and so when I couldn't stand it no
longer I lit out.  I got into my old rags and my sugar-hogshead
again, and was free and satisfied.  But Tom Sawyer he hunted me
up and said he was going to start a band of robbers, and I might
join if I would go back to the widow and be respectable.  So I
went back.</p>

<p>The widow she cried over me, and called me a poor lost lamb,
and she called me a lot of other names, too, but she never meant
no harm by it. She put me in them new clothes again, and I
couldn't do nothing but sweat and sweat, and feel all cramped up.
 Well, then, the old thing commenced again.  The widow rung a
bell for supper, and you had to come to time. When you got to the
table you couldn't go right to eating, but you had to wait for
the widow to tuck down her head and grumble a little over the
victuals, though there warn't really anything the matter with
them,&mdash;that is, nothing only everything was cooked by
itself.  In a barrel of odds and ends it is different; things get
mixed up, and the juice kind of swaps around, and the things go
better.</p>

<p>After supper she got out her book and learned me about Moses
and the Bulrushers, and I was in a sweat to find out all about
him; but by and by she let it out that Moses had been dead a
considerable long time; so then I didn't care no more about him,
because I don't take no stock in dead people.</p>

<br>
<br>
<a name="c01-18"></a> <br>
<br>
<center><img alt="c01-18.jpg (67K)" src="images/c01-18.jpg" height="528"
width="463"></center>

<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<p>Pretty soon I wanted to smoke, and asked the widow to let me.
 But she wouldn't.  She said it was a mean practice and wasn't
clean, and I must try to not do it any more.  That is just the
way with some people.  They get down on a thing when they don't
know nothing about it.  Here she was a-bothering about Moses,
which was no kin to her, and no use to anybody, being gone, you
see, yet finding a power of fault with me for doing a thing that
had some good in it.  And she took snuff, too; of course that was
all right, because she done it herself.</p>

<p>Her sister, Miss Watson, a tolerable slim old maid, with
goggles on, had just come to live with her, and took a set at me
now with a spelling-book. She worked me middling hard for about
an hour, and then the widow made her ease up.  I couldn't stood
it much longer.  Then for an hour it was deadly dull, and I was
fidgety.  Miss Watson would say, "Don't put your feet up there,
Huckleberry;" and "Don't scrunch up like that,
Huckleberry&mdash;set up straight;" and pretty soon she would
say, "Don't gap and stretch like that, Huckleberry&mdash;why
don't you try to behave?"  Then she told me all about the bad
place, and I said I wished I was there. She got mad then, but I
didn't mean no harm.  All I wanted was to go somewheres; all I
wanted was a change, I warn't particular.  She said it was wicked
to say what I said; said she wouldn't say it for the whole world;
she was going to live so as to go to the good place.  Well, I
couldn't see no advantage in going where she was going, so I made
up my mind I wouldn't try for it.  But I never said so, because
it would only make trouble, and wouldn't do no good.</p>

<br>
<br>
<a name="c01-19"></a> <br>
<br>
<center><img alt="c01-19.jpg (46K)" src="images/c01-19.jpg" height="544"
width="338"></center>

<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<p>Now she had got a start, and she went on and told me all about
the good place.  She said all a body would have to do there was
to go around all day long with a harp and sing, forever and ever.
 So I didn't think much of it. But I never said so.  I asked her
if she reckoned Tom Sawyer would go there, and she said not by a
considerable sight.  I was glad about that, because I wanted him
and me to be together.</p>

<p>Miss Watson she kept pecking at me, and it got tiresome and
lonesome.  By and by they fetched the niggers in and had prayers,
and then everybody was off to bed.  I went up to my room with a
piece of candle, and put it on the table.  Then I set down in a
chair by the window and tried to think of something cheerful, but
it warn't no use.  I felt so lonesome I most wished I was dead.
 The stars were shining, and the leaves rustled in the woods ever
so mournful; and I heard an owl, away off, who-whooing about
somebody that was dead, and a whippowill and a dog crying about
somebody that was going to die; and the wind was trying to
whisper something to me, and I couldn't make out what it was, and
so it made the cold shivers run over me. Then away out in the
woods I heard that kind of a sound that a ghost makes when it
wants to tell about something that's on its mind and can't make
itself understood, and so can't rest easy in its grave, and has
to go about that way every night grieving.  I got so down-hearted
and scared I did wish I had some company.  Pretty soon a spider
went crawling up my shoulder, and I flipped it off and it lit in
the candle; and before I could budge it was all shriveled up.  I
didn't need anybody to tell me that that was an awful bad sign
and would fetch me some bad luck, so I was scared and most shook
the clothes off of me. I got up and turned around in my tracks
three times and crossed my breast every time; and then I tied up
a little lock of my hair with a thread to keep witches away.  But
I hadn't no confidence.  You do that when you've lost a horseshoe
that you've found, instead of nailing it up over the door, but I
hadn't ever heard anybody say it was any way to keep off bad luck
when you'd killed a spider.</p>

<p>I set down again, a-shaking all over, and got out my pipe for
a smoke; for the house was all as still as death now, and so the
widow wouldn't know. Well, after a long time I heard the clock
away off in the town go boom&mdash;boom&mdash;boom&mdash;twelve
licks; and all still again&mdash;stiller than ever. Pretty soon I
heard a twig snap down in the dark amongst the
trees&mdash;something was a stirring.  I set still and listened.  Directly I
could just barely hear a "me-yow! me-yow!" down there.  That was
good!  Says I, "me-yow! me-yow!" as soft as I could, and then I
put out the light and scrambled out of the window on to the shed.
 Then I slipped down to the ground and crawled in among the
trees, and, sure enough, there was Tom Sawyer waiting for me.</p>

 CHAPTER II.</p>

<p>WE went tiptoeing along a path amongst the trees back towards
the end of the widow's garden, stooping down so as the branches
wouldn't scrape our heads. When we was passing by the kitchen I
fell over a root and made a noise.  We scrouched down and laid
still.  Miss Watson's big nigger, named Jim, was setting in the
kitchen door; we could see him pretty clear, because there was a
light behind him.  He got up and stretched his neck out about a
minute, listening.  Then he says:</p>

<p>"Who dah?"</p>

<p>He listened some more; then he come tiptoeing down and stood
right between us; we could a touched him, nearly.  Well, likely
it was minutes and minutes that there warn't a sound, and we all
there so close together.  There was a place on my ankle that got
to itching, but I dasn't scratch it; and then my ear begun to
itch; and next my back, right between my shoulders.  Seemed like
I'd die if I couldn't scratch.  Well, I've noticed that thing
plenty times since.  If you are with the quality, or at a
funeral, or trying to go to sleep when you ain't sleepy&mdash;if
you are anywheres where it won't do for you to scratch, why you
will itch all over in upwards of a thousand places. Pretty soon
Jim says:</p>

<p>"Say, who is you?  Whar is you?  Dog my cats ef I didn' hear
sumf'n. Well, I know what I's gwyne to do:  I's gwyne to set down
here and listen tell I hears it agin."</p>

<br>
<br>
<a name="c02-24"></a> <br>
<br>
<center><img alt="c02-24.jpg (38K)" src="images/c02-24.jpg" height="557"
width="303"></center>

<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<p>So he set down on the ground betwixt me and Tom.  He leaned
his back up against a tree, and stretched his legs out till one
of them most touched one of mine.  My nose begun to itch.  It
itched till the tears come into my eyes.  But I dasn't scratch.
 Then it begun to itch on the inside. Next I got to itching
underneath.  I didn't know how I was going to set still. This
miserableness went on as much as six or seven minutes; but it
seemed a sight longer than that.  I was itching in eleven
different places now.  I reckoned I couldn't stand it more'n a
minute longer, but I set my teeth hard and got ready to try.
 Just then Jim begun to breathe heavy; next he begun to
snore&mdash;and then I was pretty soon comfortable again.</p>

<p>Tom he made a sign to me&mdash;kind of a little noise with his
mouth&mdash;and we went creeping away on our hands and knees.
 When we was ten foot off Tom whispered to me, and wanted to tie
Jim to the tree for fun.  But I said no; he might wake and make a
disturbance, and then they'd find out I warn't in. Then Tom said
he hadn't got candles enough, and he would slip in the kitchen
and get some more.  I didn't want him to try.  I said Jim might
wake up and come.  But Tom wanted to resk it; so we slid in there
and got three candles, and Tom laid five cents on the table for
pay. Then we got out, and I was in a sweat to get away; but
nothing would do Tom but he must crawl to where Jim was, on his
hands and knees, and play something on him.  I waited, and it
seemed a good while, everything was so still and lonesome.</p>

<p>As soon as Tom was back we cut along the path, around the
garden fence, and by and by fetched up on the steep top of the
hill the other side of the house.  Tom said he slipped Jim's hat
off of his head and hung it on a limb right over him, and Jim
stirred a little, but he didn't wake. Afterwards Jim said the
witches be witched him and put him in a trance, and rode him all
over the State, and then set him under the trees again, and hung
his hat on a limb to show who done it.  And next time Jim told it
he said they rode him down to New Orleans; and, after that, every
time he told it he spread it more and more, till by and by he
said they rode him all over the world, and tired him most to
death, and his back was all over saddle-boils.  Jim was monstrous
proud about it, and he got so he wouldn't hardly notice the other
niggers.  Niggers would come miles to hear Jim tell about it, and
he was more looked up to than any nigger in that country.
 Strange niggers would stand with their mouths open and look him
all over, same as if he was a wonder.  Niggers is always talking
about witches in the dark by the kitchen fire; but whenever one
was talking and letting on to know all about such things, Jim
would happen in and say, "Hm!  What you know 'bout witches?" and
that nigger was corked up and had to take a back seat.  Jim
always kept that five-center piece round his neck with a string,
and said it was a charm the devil give to him with his own hands,
and told him he could cure anybody with it and fetch witches
whenever he wanted to just by saying something to it; but he
never told what it was he said to it.  Niggers would come from
all around there and give Jim anything they had, just for a sight
of that five-center piece; but they wouldn't touch it, because
the devil had had his hands on it.  Jim was most ruined for a
servant, because he got stuck up on account of having seen the
devil and been rode by witches.</p>

<p>Well, when Tom and me got to the edge of the hilltop we looked
away down into the village and could see three or four lights
twinkling, where there was sick folks, maybe; and the stars over
us was sparkling ever so fine; and down by the village was the
river, a whole mile broad, and awful still and grand.  We went
down the hill and found Jo Harper and Ben Rogers, and two or
three more of the boys, hid in the old tanyard.  So we unhitched
a skiff and pulled down the river two mile and a half, to the big
scar on the hillside, and went ashore.</p>

<p>We went to a clump of bushes, and Tom made everybody swear to
keep the secret, and then showed them a hole in the hill, right
in the thickest part of the bushes.  Then we lit the candles, and
crawled in on our hands and knees.  We went about two hundred
yards, and then the cave opened up. Tom poked about amongst the
passages, and pretty soon ducked under a wall where you wouldn't
a noticed that there was a hole.  We went along a narrow place
and got into a kind of room, all damp and sweaty and cold, and
there we stopped.  Tom says:</p>

<p>"Now, we'll start this band of robbers and call it Tom
Sawyer's Gang. Everybody that wants to join has got to take an
oath, and write his name in blood."</p>

<br>
<br>
<a name="c02-25"></a> <br>
<br>
<center><img alt="c02-25.jpg (68K)" src="images/c02-25.jpg" height="444"
width="665"></center>

<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<p>Everybody was willing.  So Tom got out a sheet of paper that
he had wrote the oath on, and read it.  It swore every boy to
stick to the band, and never tell any of the secrets; and if
anybody done anything to any boy in the band, whichever boy was
ordered to kill that person and his family must do it, and he
mustn't eat and he mustn't sleep till he had killed them and
hacked a cross in their breasts, which was the sign of the band.
And nobody that didn't belong to the band could use that mark,
and if he did he must be sued; and if he done it again he must be
killed.  And if anybody that belonged to the band told the
secrets, he must have his throat cut, and then have his carcass
burnt up and the ashes scattered all around, and his name blotted
off of the list with blood and never mentioned again by the gang,
but have a curse put on it and be forgot forever.</p>

<p>Everybody said it was a real beautiful oath, and asked Tom if
he got it out of his own head.  He said, some of it, but the rest
was out of pirate-books and robber-books, and every gang that was
high-toned had it.</p>

<p>Some thought it would be good to kill the FAMILIES of boys
that told the secrets.  Tom said it was a good idea, so he took a
pencil and wrote it in. Then Ben Rogers says:</p>

<p>"Here's Huck Finn, he hain't got no family; what you going to
do 'bout him?"</p>

<p>"Well, hain't he got a father?" says Tom Sawyer.</p>

<p>"Yes, he's got a father, but you can't never find him these
days.  He used to lay drunk with the hogs in the tanyard, but he
hain't been seen in these parts for a year or more."</p>

<p>They talked it over, and they was going to rule me out,
because they said every boy must have a family or somebody to
kill, or else it wouldn't be fair and square for the others.
 Well, nobody could think of anything to do&mdash;everybody was
stumped, and set still.  I was most ready to cry; but all at once
I thought of a way, and so I offered them Miss Watson&mdash;they
could kill her.  Everybody said:</p>

<p>"Oh, she'll do.  That's all right.  Huck can come in."</p>

<p>Then they all stuck a pin in their fingers to get blood to
sign with, and I made my mark on the paper.</p>

<p>"Now," says Ben Rogers, "what's the line of business of this
Gang?"</p>

<p>"Nothing only robbery and murder," Tom said.</p>

<p>"But who are we going to rob?&mdash;houses, or cattle,
or&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Stuff! stealing cattle and such things ain't robbery; it's
burglary," says Tom Sawyer.  "We ain't burglars.  That ain't no
sort of style.  We are highwaymen.  We stop stages and carriages
on the road, with masks on, and kill the people and take their
watches and money."</p>

<p>"Must we always kill the people?"</p>

<p>"Oh, certainly.  It's best.  Some authorities think different,
but mostly it's considered best to kill them&mdash;except some
that you bring to the cave here, and keep them till they're
ransomed."</p>

<p>"Ransomed?  What's that?"</p>

<p>"I don't know.  But that's what they do.  I've seen it in
books; and so of course that's what we've got to do."</p>

<p>"But how can we do it if we don't know what it is?"</p>

<p>"Why, blame it all, we've GOT to do it.  Don't I tell you it's
in the books?  Do you want to go to doing different from what's
in the books, and get things all muddled up?"</p>

<p>"Oh, that's all very fine to SAY, Tom Sawyer, but how in the
nation are these fellows going to be ransomed if we don't know
how to do it to them?&mdash;that's the thing I want to get at.
 Now, what do you reckon it is?"</p>

<p>"Well, I don't know.  But per'aps if we keep them till they're
ransomed, it means that we keep them till they're dead."</p>

<p>"Now, that's something LIKE.  That'll answer.  Why couldn't
you said that before?  We'll keep them till they're ransomed to
death; and a bothersome lot they'll be, too&mdash;eating up
everything, and always trying to get loose."</p>

<p>"How you talk, Ben Rogers.  How can they get loose when
there's a guard over them, ready to shoot them down if they move
a peg?"</p>

<p>"A guard!  Well, that IS good.  So somebody's got to set up
all night and never get any sleep, just so as to watch them.  I
think that's foolishness. Why can't a body take a club and ransom
them as soon as they get here?"</p>

<p>"Because it ain't in the books so&mdash;that's why.  Now, Ben
Rogers, do you want to do things regular, or don't
you?&mdash;that's the idea.  Don't you reckon that the people
that made the books knows what's the correct thing to do?  Do you
reckon YOU can learn 'em anything?  Not by a good deal. No, sir,
we'll just go on and ransom them in the regular way."</p>

<p>"All right.  I don't mind; but I say it's a fool way, anyhow.
 Say, do we kill the women, too?"</p>

<p>"Well, Ben Rogers, if I was as ignorant as you I wouldn't let
on.  Kill the women?  No; nobody ever saw anything in the books
like that.  You fetch them to the cave, and you're always as
polite as pie to them; and by and by they fall in love with you,
and never want to go home any more."</p>

<p>"Well, if that's the way I'm agreed, but I don't take no stock
in it. Mighty soon we'll have the cave so cluttered up with
women, and fellows waiting to be ransomed, that there won't be no
place for the robbers. But go ahead, I ain't got nothing to
say."</p>

<p>Little Tommy Barnes was asleep now, and when they waked him up
he was scared, and cried, and said he wanted to go home to his
ma, and didn't want to be a robber any more.</p>

<p>So they all made fun of him, and called him cry-baby, and that
made him mad, and he said he would go straight and tell all the
secrets.  But Tom give him five cents to keep quiet, and said we
would all go home and meet next week, and rob somebody and kill
some people.</p>

<p>Ben Rogers said he couldn't get out much, only Sundays, and so
he wanted to begin next Sunday; but all the boys said it would be
wicked to do it on Sunday, and that settled the thing.  They
agreed to get together and fix a day as soon as they could, and
then we elected Tom Sawyer first captain and Jo Harper second
captain of the Gang, and so started home.</p>

<p>I clumb up the shed and crept into my window just before day
was breaking. My new clothes was all greased up and clayey, and I
was dog-tired.</p>

CHAPTER III.</p>

<p>WELL, I got a good going-over in the morning from old Miss
Watson on account of my clothes; but the widow she didn't scold,
but only cleaned off the grease and clay, and looked so sorry
that I thought I would behave awhile if I could.  Then Miss
Watson she took me in the closet and prayed, but nothing come of
it.  She told me to pray every day, and whatever I asked for I
would get it.  But it warn't so.  I tried it. Once I got a
fish-line, but no hooks.  It warn't any good to me without hooks.
 I tried for the hooks three or four times, but somehow I
couldn't make it work.  By and by, one day, I asked Miss Watson
to try for me, but she said I was a fool.  She never told me why,
and I couldn't make it out no way.</p>

<p>I set down one time back in the woods, and had a long think
about it.  I says to myself, if a body can get anything they pray
for, why don't Deacon Winn get back the money he lost on pork?
 Why can't the widow get back her silver snuffbox that was stole?
 Why can't Miss Watson fat up? No, says I to my self, there ain't
nothing in it.  I went and told the widow about it, and she said
the thing a body could get by praying for it was "spiritual
gifts."  This was too many for me, but she told me what she
meant&mdash;I must help other people, and do everything I could
for other people, and look out for them all the time, and never
think about myself. This was including Miss Watson, as I took it.
 I went out in the woods and turned it over in my mind a long
time, but I couldn't see no advantage about it&mdash;except for
the other people; so at last I reckoned I wouldn't worry about it
any more, but just let it go.  Sometimes the widow would take me
one side and talk about Providence in a way to make a body's
mouth water; but maybe next day Miss Watson would take hold and
knock it all down again.  I judged I could see that there was two
Providences, and a poor chap would stand considerable show with
the widow's Providence, but if Miss Watson's got him there warn't
no help for him any more.  I thought it all out, and reckoned I
would belong to the widow's if he wanted me, though I couldn't
make out how he was a-going to be any better off then than what
he was before, seeing I was so ignorant, and so kind of low-down
and ornery.</p>

<p>Pap he hadn't been seen for more than a year, and that was
comfortable for me; I didn't want to see him no more.  He used to
always whale me when he was sober and could get his hands on me;
though I used to take to the woods most of the time when he was
around.  Well, about this time he was found in the river
drownded, about twelve mile above town, so people said.  They
judged it was him, anyway; said this drownded man was just his
size, and was ragged, and had uncommon long hair, which was all
like pap; but they couldn't make nothing out of the face, because
it had been in the water so long it warn't much like a face at
all.  They said he was floating on his back in the water.  They
took him and buried him on the bank.  But I warn't comfortable
long, because I happened to think of something.  I knowed mighty
well that a drownded man don't float on his back, but on his
face.  So I knowed, then, that this warn't pap, but a woman
dressed up in a man's clothes.  So I was uncomfortable again.  I
judged the old man would turn up again by and by, though I wished
he wouldn't.</p>

<p>We played robber now and then about a month, and then I
resigned.  All the boys did.  We hadn't robbed nobody, hadn't
killed any people, but only just pretended.  We used to hop out
of the woods and go charging down on hog-drivers and women in
carts taking garden stuff to market, but we never hived any of
them.  Tom Sawyer called the hogs "ingots," and he called the
turnips and stuff "julery," and we would go to the cave and
powwow over what we had done, and how many people we had killed
and marked.  But I couldn't see no profit in it.  One time Tom
sent a boy to run about town with a blazing stick, which he
called a slogan (which was the sign for the Gang to get
together), and then he said he had got secret news by his spies
that next day a whole parcel of Spanish merchants and rich A-rabs
was going to camp in Cave Hollow with two hundred elephants, and
six hundred camels, and over a thousand "sumter" mules, all
loaded down with di'monds, and they didn't have only a guard of
four hundred soldiers, and so we would lay in ambuscade, as he
called it, and kill the lot and scoop the things.  He said we
must slick up our swords and guns, and get ready.  He never could
go after even a turnip-cart but he must have the swords and guns
all scoured up for it, though they was only lath and broomsticks,
and you might scour at them till you rotted, and then they warn't
worth a mouthful of ashes more than what they was before.  I
didn't believe we could lick such a crowd of Spaniards and
A-rabs, but I wanted to see the camels and elephants, so I was on
hand next day, Saturday, in the ambuscade; and when we got the
word we rushed out of the woods and down the hill.  But there
warn't no Spaniards and A-rabs, and there warn't no camels nor no
elephants.  It warn't anything but a Sunday-school picnic, and
only a primer-class at that.  We busted it up, and chased the
children up the hollow; but we never got anything but some
doughnuts and jam, though Ben Rogers got a rag doll, and Jo
Harper got a hymn-book and a tract; and then the teacher charged
in, and made us drop everything and cut.</p>

<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<p> I didn't see no di'monds, and I told Tom Sawyer so.  He said
there was loads of them there, anyway; and he said there was
A-rabs there, too, and elephants and things.  I said, why
couldn't we see them, then?  He said if I warn't so ignorant, but
had read a book called Don Quixote, I would know without asking.
 He said it was all done by enchantment.  He said there was
hundreds of soldiers there, and elephants and treasure, and so
on, but we had enemies which he called magicians; and they had
turned the whole thing into an infant Sunday-school, just out of
spite.  I said, all right; then the thing for us to do was to go
for the magicians.  Tom Sawyer said I was a numskull.</p>

<p>"Why," said he, "a magician could call up a lot of genies, and
they would hash you up like nothing before you could say Jack
Robinson.  They are as tall as a tree and as big around as a
church."</p>

<p>"Well," I says, "s'pose we got some genies to help
US&mdash;can't we lick the other crowd then?"</p>

<p>"How you going to get them?"</p>

<p>"I don't know.  How do THEY get them?"</p>

<p>"Why, they rub an old tin lamp or an iron ring, and then the
genies come tearing in, with the thunder and lightning a-ripping
around and the smoke a-rolling, and everything they're told to do
they up and do it.  They don't think nothing of pulling a
shot-tower up by the roots, and belting a Sunday-school
superintendent over the head with it&mdash;or any other man."</p>

<p>"Who makes them tear around so?"</p>

<p>"Why, whoever rubs the lamp or the ring.  They belong to
whoever rubs the lamp or the ring, and they've got to do whatever
he says.  If he tells them to build a palace forty miles long out
of di'monds, and fill it full of chewing-gum, or whatever you
want, and fetch an emperor's daughter from China for you to
marry, they've got to do it&mdash;and they've got to do it before
sun-up next morning, too.  And more:  they've got to waltz that
palace around over the country wherever you want it, you
understand."</p>

<p>"Well," says I, "I think they are a pack of flat-heads for not
keeping the palace themselves 'stead of fooling them away like
that.  And what's more&mdash;if I was one of them I would see a
man in Jericho before I would drop my business and come to him
for the rubbing of an old tin lamp."</p>

<p>"How you talk, Huck Finn.  Why, you'd HAVE to come when he
rubbed it, whether you wanted to or not."</p>

<p>"What! and I as high as a tree and as big as a church?  All
right, then; I WOULD come; but I lay I'd make that man climb the
highest tree there was in the country."</p>

<p>"Shucks, it ain't no use to talk to you, Huck Finn.  You don't
seem to know anything, somehow&mdash;perfect saphead."</p>

<p>I thought all this over for two or three days, and then I
reckoned I would see if there was anything in it.  I got an old
tin lamp and an iron ring, and went out in the woods and rubbed
and rubbed till I sweat like an Injun, calculating to build a
palace and sell it; but it warn't no use, none of the genies
come.  So then I judged that all that stuff was only just one of
Tom Sawyer's lies.  I reckoned he believed in the A-rabs and the
elephants, but as for me I think different.  It had all the marks
of a Sunday-school.</p>

CHAPTER IV.</p>

<p>WELL, three or four months run along, and it was well into the
winter now. I had been to school most all the time and could
spell and read and write just a little, and could say the
multiplication table up to six times seven is thirty-five, and I
don't reckon I could ever get any further than that if I was to
live forever.  I don't take no stock in mathematics, anyway.</p>

<p>At first I hated the school, but by and by I got so I could
stand it. Whenever I got uncommon tired I played hookey, and the
hiding I got next day done me good and cheered me up.  So the
longer I went to school the easier it got to be.  I was getting
sort of used to the widow's ways, too, and they warn't so raspy
on me.  Living in a house and sleeping in a bed pulled on me
pretty tight mostly, but before the cold weather I used to slide
out and sleep in the woods sometimes, and so that was a rest to
me.  I liked the old ways best, but I was getting so I liked the
new ones, too, a little bit. The widow said I was coming along
slow but sure, and doing very satisfactory.  She said she warn't
ashamed of me.</p>

<p>One morning I happened to turn over the salt-cellar at
breakfast.  I reached for some of it as quick as I could to throw
over my left shoulder and keep off the bad luck, but Miss Watson
was in ahead of me, and crossed me off. She says, "Take your
hands away, Huckleberry; what a mess you are always making!"  The
widow put in a good word for me, but that warn't going to keep
off the bad luck, I knowed that well enough.  I started out,
after breakfast, feeling worried and shaky, and wondering where
it was going to fall on me, and what it was going to be.  There
is ways to keep off some kinds of bad luck, but this wasn't one
of them kind; so I never tried to do anything, but just poked
along low-spirited and on the watch-out.</p>

<p>I went down to the front garden and clumb over the stile where
you go through the high board fence.  There was an inch of new
snow on the ground, and I seen somebody's tracks.  They had come
up from the quarry and stood around the stile a while, and then
went on around the garden fence.  It was funny they hadn't come
in, after standing around so.  I couldn't make it out.  It was
very curious, somehow.  I was going to follow around, but I
stooped down to look at the tracks first.  I didn't notice
anything at first, but next I did.  There was a cross in the left
boot-heel made with big nails, to keep off the devil.</p>

<p>I was up in a second and shinning down the hill.  I looked
over my shoulder every now and then, but I didn't see nobody.  I
was at Judge Thatcher's as quick as I could get there.  He
said:</p>

<p>"Why, my boy, you are all out of breath.  Did you come for
your interest?"</p>

<p>"No, sir," I says; "is there some for me?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, a half-yearly is in last night&mdash;over a hundred
and fifty dollars.  Quite a fortune for you.  You had better let
me invest it along with your six thousand, because if you take it
you'll spend it."</p>

<p>"No, sir," I says, "I don't want to spend it.  I don't want it
at all&mdash;nor the six thousand, nuther.  I want you to take
it; I want to give it to you&mdash;the six thousand and all."</p>

<br>
<br>

<br>

<center><img alt="c04-36.jpg (50K)" src="images/c04-36.jpg" height="557"
width="491"></center>

<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<p>He looked surprised.  He couldn't seem to make it out.  He
says:</p>

<p>"Why, what can you mean, my boy?"</p>

<p>I says, "Don't you ask me no questions about it, please.
 You'll take it&mdash;won't you?"</p>

<p>He says:</p>

<p>"Well, I'm puzzled.  Is something the matter?"</p>

<p>"Please take it," says I, "and don't ask me nothing&mdash;then
I won't have to tell no lies."</p>

<p>He studied a while, and then he says:</p>

<p>"Oho-o!  I think I see.  You want to SELL all your property to
me&mdash;not give it.  That's the correct idea."</p>

<p>Then he wrote something on a paper and read it over, and
says:</p>

<p>"There; you see it says 'for a consideration.'  That means I
have bought it of you and paid you for it.  Here's a dollar for
you.  Now you sign it."</p>

<p>So I signed it, and left.</p>

<p>Miss Watson's nigger, Jim, had a hair-ball as big as your
fist, which had been took out of the fourth stomach of an ox, and
he used to do magic with it.  He said there was a spirit inside
of it, and it knowed everything.  So I went to him that night and
told him pap was here again, for I found his tracks in the snow.
 What I wanted to know was, what he was going to do, and was he
going to stay?  Jim got out his hair-ball and said something over
it, and then he held it up and dropped it on the floor.  It fell
pretty solid, and only rolled about an inch.  Jim tried it again,
and then another time, and it acted just the same.  Jim got down
on his knees, and put his ear against it and listened.  But it
warn't no use; he said it wouldn't talk. He said sometimes it
wouldn't talk without money.  I told him I had an old slick
counterfeit quarter that warn't no good because the brass showed
through the silver a little, and it wouldn't pass nohow, even if
the brass didn't show, because it was so slick it felt greasy,
and so that would tell on it every time.  (I reckoned I wouldn't
say nothing about the dollar I got from the judge.) I said it was
pretty bad money, but maybe the hair-ball would take it, because
maybe it wouldn't know the difference.  Jim smelt it and bit it
and rubbed it, and said he would manage so the hair-ball would
think it was good.  He said he would split open a raw Irish
potato and stick the quarter in between and keep it there all
night, and next morning you couldn't see no brass, and it
wouldn't feel greasy no more, and so anybody in town would take
it in a minute, let alone a hair-ball.  Well, I knowed a potato
would do that before, but I had forgot it.</p>

<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<p>Jim put the quarter under the hair-ball, and got down and
listened again. This time he said the hair-ball was all right.
 He said it would tell my whole fortune if I wanted it to.  I
says, go on.  So the hair-ball talked to Jim, and Jim told it to
me.  He says:</p>

<p>"Yo' ole father doan' know yit what he's a-gwyne to do.
 Sometimes he spec he'll go 'way, en den agin he spec he'll stay.
 De bes' way is to res' easy en let de ole man take his own way.
 Dey's two angels hoverin' roun' 'bout him.  One uv 'em is white
en shiny, en t'other one is black. De white one gits him to go
right a little while, den de black one sail in en bust it all up.
 A body can't tell yit which one gwyne to fetch him at de las'.
 But you is all right.  You gwyne to have considable trouble in
yo' life, en considable joy.  Sometimes you gwyne to git hurt, en
sometimes you gwyne to git sick; but every time you's gwyne to
git well agin.  Dey's two gals flyin' 'bout you in yo' life.  One
uv 'em's light en t'other one is dark. One is rich en t'other is

by.  You wants to keep 'way fum de water as much as you kin, en
don't run no resk, 'kase it's down in de bills dat you's gwyne to

CHAPTER V.</p>

<p>I HAD shut the door to.  Then I turned around and there he
was.  I used to be scared of him all the time, he tanned me so
much.  I reckoned I was scared now, too; but in a minute I see I
was mistaken&mdash;that is, after the first jolt, as you may say,
when my breath sort of hitched, he being so unexpected; but right
away after I see I warn't scared of him worth bothring about.</p>

<p>He was most fifty, and he looked it.  His hair was long and
tangled and greasy, and hung down, and you could see his eyes
shining through like he was behind vines.  It was all black, no
gray; so was his long, mixed-up whiskers.  There warn't no color
in his face, where his face showed; it was white; not like
another man's white, but a white to make a body sick, a white to
make a body's flesh crawl&mdash;a tree-toad white, a fish-belly
white.  As for his clothes&mdash;just rags, that was all.  He had
one ankle resting on t'other knee; the boot on that foot was
busted, and two of his toes stuck through, and he worked them now
and then.  His hat was laying on the floor&mdash;an old black
slouch with the top caved in, like a lid.</p>

<p>I stood a-looking at him; he set there a-looking at me, with
his chair tilted back a little.  I set the candle down.  I
noticed the window was up; so he had clumb in by the shed.  He
kept a-looking me all over.  By and by he says:</p>

<p>"Starchy clothes&mdash;very.  You think you're a good deal of
a big-bug, DON'T you?"</p>

<p>"Maybe I am, maybe I ain't," I says.</p>

<p>"Don't you give me none o' your lip," says he.  "You've put on
considerable many frills since I been away.  I'll take you down a
peg before I get done with you.  You're educated, too, they
say&mdash;can read and write.  You think you're better'n your
father, now, don't you, because he can't?  I'LL take it out of
you.  Who told you you might meddle with such hifalut'n
foolishness, hey?&mdash;who told you you could?"</p>

<p>"The widow.  She told me."</p>

<p>"The widow, hey?&mdash;and who told the widow she could put in
her shovel about a thing that ain't none of her business?"</p>

<p>"Nobody never told her."</p>

<p>"Well, I'll learn her how to meddle.  And looky here&mdash;you
drop that school, you hear?  I'll learn people to bring up a boy
to put on airs over his own father and let on to be better'n what
HE is.  You lemme catch you fooling around that school again, you
hear?  Your mother couldn't read, and she couldn't write, nuther,
before she died.  None of the family couldn't before THEY died.
 I can't; and here you're a-swelling yourself up like this.  I
ain't the man to stand it&mdash;you hear? Say, lemme hear you
read."</p>

<p>I took up a book and begun something about General Washington
and the wars. When I'd read about a half a minute, he fetched the
book a whack with his hand and knocked it across the house.  He
says:</p>

<p>"It's so.  You can do it.  I had my doubts when you told me.
 Now looky here; you stop that putting on frills.  I won't have
it.  I'll lay for you, my smarty; and if I catch you about that
school I'll tan you good. First you know you'll get religion,
too.  I never see such a son."</p>

<p>He took up a little blue and yaller picture of some cows and a
boy, and says:</p>

<p>"What's this?"</p>

<p>"It's something they give me for learning my lessons
good."</p>

<p>He tore it up, and says:</p>

<p>"I'll give you something better&mdash;I'll give you a
cowhide."</p>

<p>He set there a-mumbling and a-growling a minute, and then he
says:</p>

<p>"AIN'T you a sweet-scented dandy, though?  A bed; and
bedclothes; and a look'n'-glass; and a piece of carpet on the
floor&mdash;and your own father got to sleep with the hogs in the
tanyard.  I never see such a son.  I bet I'll take some o' these
frills out o' you before I'm done with you. Why, there ain't no
end to your airs&mdash;they say you're rich.  Hey?&mdash;how's
that?"</p>

<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<p>"They lie&mdash;that's how."</p>

<p>"Looky here&mdash;mind how you talk to me; I'm a-standing
about all I can stand now&mdash;so don't gimme no sass.  I've
been in town two days, and I hain't heard nothing but about you
bein' rich.  I heard about it away down the river, too.  That's
why I come.  You git me that money to-morrow&mdash;I want
it."</p>

<p>"I hain't got no money."</p>

<p>"It's a lie.  Judge Thatcher's got it.  You git it.  I want
it."</p>

<p>"I hain't got no money, I tell you.  You ask Judge Thatcher;
he'll tell you the same."</p>

<p>"All right.  I'll ask him; and I'll make him pungle, too, or
I'll know the reason why.  Say, how much you got in your pocket?
 I want it."</p>

<p>"I hain't got only a dollar, and I want that to&mdash;"</p>

<p>"It don't make no difference what you want it for&mdash;you
just shell it out."</p>

<p>He took it and bit it to see if it was good, and then he said
he was going down town to get some whisky; said he hadn't had a
drink all day. When he had got out on the shed he put his head in
again, and cussed me for putting on frills and trying to be
better than him; and when I reckoned he was gone he come back and
put his head in again, and told me to mind about that school,
because he was going to lay for me and lick me if I didn't drop
that.</p>

<p>Next day he was drunk, and he went to Judge Thatcher's and
bullyragged him, and tried to make him give up the money; but he
couldn't, and then he swore he'd make the law force him.</p>

<p>The judge and the widow went to law to get the court to take
me away from him and let one of them be my guardian; but it was a
new judge that had just come, and he didn't know the old man; so
he said courts mustn't interfere and separate families if they
could help it; said he'd druther not take a child away from its
father.  So Judge Thatcher and the widow had to quit on the
business.</p>

<p>That pleased the old man till he couldn't rest.  He said he'd
cowhide me till I was black and blue if I didn't raise some money
for him.  I borrowed three dollars from Judge Thatcher, and pap
took it and got drunk, and went a-blowing around and cussing and
whooping and carrying on; and he kept it up all over town, with a
tin pan, till most midnight; then they jailed him, and next day
they had him before court, and jailed him again for a week.  But
he said HE was satisfied; said he was boss of his son, and he'd
make it warm for HIM.</p>

<p>When he got out the new judge said he was a-going to make a
man of him. So he took him to his own house, and dressed him up
clean and nice, and had him to breakfast and dinner and supper
with the family, and was just old pie to him, so to speak.  And
after supper he talked to him about temperance and such things
till the old man cried, and said he'd been a fool, and fooled
away his life; but now he was a-going to turn over a new leaf and
be a man nobody wouldn't be ashamed of, and he hoped the judge
would help him and not look down on him.  The judge said he could
hug him for them words; so he cried, and his wife she cried
again; pap said he'd been a man that had always been
misunderstood before, and the judge said he believed it.  The old
man said that what a man wanted that was down was sympathy, and
the judge said it was so; so they cried again.  And when it was
bedtime the old man rose up and held out his hand, and says:</p>

<p>"Look at it, gentlemen and ladies all; take a-hold of it;
shake it. There's a hand that was the hand of a hog; but it ain't
so no more; it's the hand of a man that's started in on a new
life, and'll die before he'll go back.  You mark them
words&mdash;don't forget I said them.  It's a clean hand now;
shake it&mdash;don't be afeard."</p>

<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<p>So they shook it, one after the other, all around, and cried.
 The judge's wife she kissed it.  Then the old man he signed a
pledge&mdash;made his mark. The judge said it was the holiest
time on record, or something like that. Then they tucked the old
man into a beautiful room, which was the spare room, and in the
night some time he got powerful thirsty and clumb out on to the
porch-roof and slid down a stanchion and traded his new coat for
a jug of forty-rod, and clumb back again and had a good old time;
and towards daylight he crawled out again, drunk as a fiddler,
and rolled off the porch and broke his left arm in two places,
and was most froze to death when somebody found him after sun-up.
 And when they come to look at that spare room they had to take
soundings before they could navigate it.</p>

<p>The judge he felt kind of sore.  He said he reckoned a body
could reform the old man with a shotgun, maybe, but he didn't
know no other way.</p>
