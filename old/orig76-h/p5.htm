CHAPTER XXI.</p>

<p>IT was after sun-up now, but we went right on and didn't tie
up.  The king and the duke turned out by and by looking pretty
rusty; but after they'd jumped overboard and took a swim it
chippered them up a good deal. After breakfast the king he took a
seat on the corner of the raft, and pulled off his boots and
rolled up his britches, and let his legs dangle in the water, so
as to be comfortable, and lit his pipe, and went to getting his
Romeo and Juliet by heart.  When he had got it pretty good him
and the duke begun to practice it together.  The duke had to
learn him over and over again how to say every speech; and he
made him sigh, and put his hand on his heart, and after a while
he said he done it pretty well; "only," he says, "you mustn't
bellow out ROMEO! that way, like a bull&mdash;you must say it
soft and sick and languishy, so&mdash;R-o-o-meo! that is the
idea; for Juliet's a dear sweet mere child of a girl, you know,
and she doesn't bray like a jackass."</p>

<p>Well, next they got out a couple of long swords that the duke
made out of oak laths, and begun to practice the sword
fight&mdash;the duke called himself Richard III.; and the way
they laid on and pranced around the raft was grand to see.  But
by and by the king tripped and fell overboard, and after that
they took a rest, and had a talk about all kinds of adventures
they'd had in other times along the river.</p>

<p>After dinner the duke says:</p>

<p>"Well, Capet, we'll want to make this a first-class show, you
know, so I guess we'll add a little more to it.  We want a little
something to answer encores with, anyway."</p>

<p>"What's onkores, Bilgewater?"</p>

<p>The duke told him, and then says:</p>

<p>"I'll answer by doing the Highland fling or the sailor's
hornpipe; and you&mdash;well, let me see&mdash;oh, I've got
it&mdash;you can do Hamlet's soliloquy."</p>

<p>"Hamlet's which?"</p>

<p>"Hamlet's soliloquy, you know; the most celebrated thing in
Shakespeare. Ah, it's sublime, sublime!  Always fetches the
house.  I haven't got it in the book&mdash;I've only got one
volume&mdash;but I reckon I can piece it out from memory.  I'll
just walk up and down a minute, and see if I can call it back
from recollection's vaults."</p>

<p>So he went to marching up and down, thinking, and frowning
horrible every now and then; then he would hoist up his eyebrows;
next he would squeeze his hand on his forehead and stagger back
and kind of moan; next he would sigh, and next he'd let on to
drop a tear.  It was beautiful to see him. By and by he got it.
 He told us to give attention.  Then he strikes a most noble
attitude, with one leg shoved forwards, and his arms stretched
away up, and his head tilted back, looking up at the sky; and
then he begins to rip and rave and grit his teeth; and after
that, all through his speech, he howled, and spread around, and
swelled up his chest, and just knocked the spots out of any
acting ever I see before.  This is the speech&mdash;I learned it,
easy enough, while he was learning it to the king:</p>

<p>All the stores was along one street.  They had white domestic
awnings in front, and the country people hitched their horses to
the awning-posts. There was empty drygoods boxes under the
awnings, and loafers roosting on them all day long, whittling
them with their Barlow knives; and chawing tobacco, and gaping
and yawning and stretching&mdash;a mighty ornery lot. They
generly had on yellow straw hats most as wide as an umbrella, but
didn't wear no coats nor waistcoats, they called one another
Bill, and Buck, and Hank, and Joe, and Andy, and talked lazy and
drawly, and used considerable many cuss words.  There was as many
as one loafer leaning up against every awning-post, and he most
always had his hands in his britches-pockets, except when he
fetched them out to lend a chaw of tobacco or scratch.  What a
body was hearing amongst them all the time was:</p>

<p>"Gimme a chaw 'v tobacker, Hank."</p>

<p>"Cain't; I hain't got but one chaw left.  Ask Bill."</p>

<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>



<p>Maybe Bill he gives him a chaw; maybe he lies and says he
ain't got none. Some of them kinds of loafers never has a cent in
the world, nor a chaw of tobacco of their own.  They get all
their chawing by borrowing; they say to a fellow, "I wisht you'd
len' me a chaw, Jack, I jist this minute give Ben Thompson the
last chaw I had"&mdash;which is a lie pretty much everytime; it
don't fool nobody but a stranger; but Jack ain't no stranger, so
he says:</p>

<p>"YOU give him a chaw, did you?  So did your sister's cat's
grandmother. You pay me back the chaws you've awready borry'd
off'n me, Lafe Buckner, then I'll loan you one or two ton of it,
and won't charge you no back intrust, nuther."</p>

<p>"Well, I DID pay you back some of it wunst."</p>

<p>"Yes, you did&mdash;'bout six chaws.  You borry'd store
tobacker and paid back nigger-head."</p>

<p>Store tobacco is flat black plug, but these fellows mostly
chaws the natural leaf twisted.  When they borrow a chaw they
don't generly cut it off with a knife, but set the plug in
between their teeth, and gnaw with their teeth and tug at the
plug with their hands till they get it in two; then sometimes the
one that owns the tobacco looks mournful at it when it's handed
back, and says, sarcastic:</p>

<p>"Here, gimme the CHAW, and you take the PLUG."</p>

<p>All the streets and lanes was just mud; they warn't nothing
else BUT mud&mdash;mud as black as tar and nigh about a foot
deep in some places, and two or three inches deep in ALL the
places.  The hogs loafed and grunted around everywheres.  You'd
see a muddy sow and a litter of pigs come lazying along the
street and whollop herself right down in the way, where folks had
to walk around her, and she'd stretch out and shut her eyes and
wave her ears whilst the pigs was milking her, and look as happy
as if she was on salary. And pretty soon you'd hear a loafer sing
out, "Hi!  SO boy! sick him, Tige!" and away the sow would go,
squealing most horrible, with a dog or two swinging to each ear,
and three or four dozen more a-coming; and then you would see
all the loafers get up and watch the thing out of sight, and
laugh at the fun and look grateful for the noise.  Then they'd
settle back again till there was a dog fight.  There couldn't
anything wake them up all over, and make them happy all over,
like a dog fight&mdash;unless it might be putting turpentine on a
stray dog and setting fire to him, or tying a tin pan to his tail
and see him run himself to death.</p>

<p>On the river front some of the houses was sticking out over
the bank, and they was bowed and bent, and about ready to tumble
in, The people had moved out of them.  The bank was caved away
under one corner of some others, and that corner was hanging
over.  People lived in them yet, but it was dangersome, because
sometimes a strip of land as wide as a house caves in at a time.
 Sometimes a belt of land a quarter of a mile deep will start in
and cave along and cave along till it all caves into the river in
one summer. Such a town as that has to be always moving back, and
back, and back, because the river's always gnawing at it.</p>

<p>The nearer it got to noon that day the thicker and thicker was
the wagons and horses in the streets, and more coming all the
time.  Families fetched their dinners with them from the country,
and eat them in the wagons.  There was considerable whisky
drinking going on, and I seen three fights.  By and by somebody
sings out:</p>

<p>"Here comes old Boggs!&mdash;in from the country for his
little old monthly drunk; here he comes, boys!"</p>

<p>All the loafers looked glad; I reckoned they was used to
having fun out of Boggs.  One of them says:</p>

<p>"Wonder who he's a-gwyne to chaw up this time.  If he'd
a-chawed up all the men he's ben a-gwyne to chaw up in the last
twenty year he'd have considerable ruputation now."</p>

<p>Another one says, "I wisht old Boggs 'd threaten me, 'cuz then
I'd know I warn't gwyne to die for a thousan' year."</p>

<p>Boggs comes a-tearing along on his horse, whooping and yelling
like an Injun, and singing out:</p>

<p>"Cler the track, thar.  I'm on the waw-path, and the price uv
coffins is a-gwyne to raise."</p>


<br>

<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

<p>He was drunk, and weaving about in his saddle; he was over
fifty year old, and had a very red face.  Everybody yelled at him
and laughed at him and sassed him, and he sassed back, and said
he'd attend to them and lay them out in their regular turns, but
he couldn't wait now because he'd come to town to kill old
Colonel Sherburn, and his motto was, "Meat first, and spoon
vittles to top off on."</p>

<p>He see me, and rode up and says:</p>

<p>"Whar'd you come f'm, boy?  You prepared to die?"</p>

<p>Then he rode on.  I was scared, but a man says:</p>

<p>"He don't mean nothing; he's always a-carryin' on like that
when he's drunk.  He's the best naturedest old fool in
Arkansaw&mdash;never hurt nobody, drunk nor sober."</p>

<p>Boggs rode up before the biggest store in town, and bent his
head down so he could see under the curtain of the awning and
yells:</p>

<p>"Come out here, Sherburn! Come out and meet the man you've
swindled. You're the houn' I'm after, and I'm a-gwyne to have
you, too!"</p>

<p>And so he went on, calling Sherburn everything he could lay
his tongue to, and the whole street packed with people listening
and laughing and going on.  By and by a proud-looking man about
fifty-five&mdash;and he was a heap the best dressed man in that
town, too&mdash;steps out of the store, and the crowd drops back
on each side to let him come.  He says to Boggs, mighty ca'm and
slow&mdash;he says:</p>

<p>"I'm tired of this, but I'll endure it till one o'clock.  Till
one o'clock, mind&mdash;no longer.  If you open your mouth
against me only once after that time you can't travel so far but
I will find you."</p>

<p>Then he turns and goes in.  The crowd looked mighty sober;
nobody stirred, and there warn't no more laughing.  Boggs rode
off blackguarding Sherburn as loud as he could yell, all down the
street; and pretty soon back he comes and stops before the store,
still keeping it up.  Some men crowded around him and tried to
get him to shut up, but he wouldn't; they told him it would be
one o'clock in about fifteen minutes, and so he MUST go
home&mdash;he must go right away.  But it didn't do no good.  He
cussed away with all his might, and throwed his hat down in the
mud and rode over it, and pretty soon away he went a-raging down
the street again, with his gray hair a-flying. Everybody that
could get a chance at him tried their best to coax him off of his
horse so they could lock him up and get him sober; but it warn't
no use&mdash;up the street he would tear again, and give Sherburn
another cussing.  By and by somebody says:</p>

<p>"Go for his daughter!&mdash;quick, go for his daughter;
sometimes he'll listen to her.  If anybody can persuade him, she
can."</p>

<p>So somebody started on a run.  I walked down street a ways and
stopped. In about five or ten minutes here comes Boggs again, but
not on his horse.  He was a-reeling across the street towards me,
bare-headed, with a friend on both sides of him a-holt of his
arms and hurrying him along. He was quiet, and looked uneasy; and
he warn't hanging back any, but was doing some of the hurrying
himself.  Somebody sings out:</p>

<p>"Boggs!"</p>

<p>I looked over there to see who said it, and it was that
Colonel Sherburn. He was standing perfectly still in the street,
and had a pistol raised in his right hand&mdash;not aiming it,
but holding it out with the barrel tilted up towards the sky.
 The same second I see a young girl coming on the run, and two
men with her.  Boggs and the men turned round to see who called
him, and when they see the pistol the men jumped to one side, and
the pistol-barrel come down slow and steady to a level&mdash;both
barrels cocked. Boggs throws up both of his hands and says, "O
Lord, don't shoot!"  Bang! goes the first shot, and he staggers
back, clawing at the air&mdash;bang! goes the second one, and he
tumbles backwards on to the ground, heavy and solid, with his
arms spread out.  That young girl screamed out and comes rushing,
and down she throws herself on her father, crying, and saying,
"Oh, he's killed him, he's killed him!"  The crowd closed up
around them, and shouldered and jammed one another, with their
necks stretched, trying to see, and people on the inside trying
to shove them back and shouting, "Back, back! give him air, give
him air!"</p>

</center>

<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>


<p>Colonel Sherburn he tossed his pistol on to the ground, and
turned around on his heels and walked off.</p>

<p>They took Boggs to a little drug store, the crowd pressing
around just the same, and the whole town following, and I rushed
and got a good place at the window, where I was close to him and
could see in.  They laid him on the floor and put one large Bible
under his head, and opened another one and spread it on his
breast; but they tore open his shirt first, and I seen where one
of the bullets went in.  He made about a dozen long gasps, his
breast lifting the Bible up when he drawed in his breath, and
letting it down again when he breathed it out&mdash;and after
that he laid still; he was dead.  Then they pulled his daughter
away from him, screaming and crying, and took her off.  She was
about sixteen, and very sweet and gentle looking, but awful pale
and scared.</p>

<p>Well, pretty soon the whole town was there, squirming and
scrouging and pushing and shoving to get at the window and have a
look, but people that had the places wouldn't give them up, and
folks behind them was saying all the time, "Say, now, you've
looked enough, you fellows; 'tain't right and 'tain't fair for
you to stay thar all the time, and never give nobody a chance;
other folks has their rights as well as you."</p>

<p>There was considerable jawing back, so I slid out, thinking
maybe there was going to be trouble.  The streets was full, and
everybody was excited. Everybody that seen the shooting was
telling how it happened, and there was a big crowd packed around
each one of these fellows, stretching their necks and listening.
 One long, lanky man, with long hair and a big white fur
stovepipe hat on the back of his head, and a crooked-handled
cane, marked out the places on the ground where Boggs stood and
where Sherburn stood, and the people following him around from
one place to t'other and watching everything he done, and bobbing
their heads to show they understood, and stooping a little and
resting their hands on their thighs to watch him mark the places
on the ground with his cane; and then he stood up straight and
stiff where Sherburn had stood, frowning and having his hat-brim
down over his eyes, and sung out, "Boggs!" and then fetched his
cane down slow to a level, and says "Bang!" staggered backwards,
says "Bang!" again, and fell down flat on his back. The people
that had seen the thing said he done it perfect; said it was just
exactly the way it all happened.  Then as much as a dozen people
got out their bottles and treated him.</p>

<p>Well, by and by somebody said Sherburn ought to be lynched.
 In about a minute everybody was saying it; so away they went,
mad and yelling, and snatching down every clothes-line they come
to to do the hanging with.</p>

CHAPTER XXII.</p>

<p>THEY swarmed up towards Sherburn's house, a-whooping and
raging like Injuns, and everything had to clear the way or get
run over and tromped to mush, and it was awful to see.  Children
was heeling it ahead of the mob, screaming and trying to get out
of the way; and every window along the road was full of women's
heads, and there was nigger boys in every tree, and bucks and
wenches looking over every fence; and as soon as the mob would
get nearly to them they would break and skaddle back out of
reach.  Lots of the women and girls was crying and taking on,
scared most to death.</p>

<p>They swarmed up in front of Sherburn's palings as thick as
they could jam together, and you couldn't hear yourself think for
the noise.  It was a little twenty-foot yard.  Some sung out
"Tear down the fence! tear down the fence!"  Then there was a
racket of ripping and tearing and smashing, and down she goes,
and the front wall of the crowd begins to roll in like a
wave.</p>

<p>Just then Sherburn steps out on to the roof of his little
front porch, with a double-barrel gun in his hand, and takes his
stand, perfectly ca'm and deliberate, not saying a word.  The
racket stopped, and the wave sucked back.</p>

<p>Sherburn never said a word&mdash;just stood there, looking
down.  The stillness was awful creepy and uncomfortable.
 Sherburn run his eye slow along the crowd; and wherever it
struck the people tried a little to out-gaze him, but they
couldn't; they dropped their eyes and looked sneaky. Then pretty
soon Sherburn sort of laughed; not the pleasant kind, but the
kind that makes you feel like when you are eating bread that's
got sand in it.</p>

<p>Then he says, slow and scornful:</p>

<p>"The idea of YOU lynching anybody!  It's amusing.  The idea of
you thinking you had pluck enough to lynch a MAN!  Because you're
brave enough to tar and feather poor friendless cast-out women
that come along here, did that make you think you had grit enough
to lay your hands on a MAN?  Why, a MAN'S safe in the hands of
ten thousand of your kind&mdash;as long as it's daytime and
you're not behind him.</p>

<p>"Do I know you?  I know you clear through was born and raised
in the South, and I've lived in the North; so I know the average
all around. The average man's a coward.  In the North he lets
anybody walk over him that wants to, and goes home and prays for
a humble spirit to bear it. In the South one man all by himself,
has stopped a stage full of men in the daytime, and robbed the
lot.  Your newspapers call you a brave people so much that you
think you are braver than any other people&mdash;whereas you're
just AS brave, and no braver.  Why don't your juries hang
murderers?  Because they're afraid the man's friends will shoot
them in the back, in the dark&mdash;and it's just what they WOULD
do.</p>

<p>"So they always acquit; and then a MAN goes in the night, with
a hundred masked cowards at his back and lynches the rascal.
 Your mistake is, that you didn't bring a man with you; that's
one mistake, and the other is that you didn't come in the dark
and fetch your masks.  You brought PART of a man&mdash;Buck
Harkness, there&mdash;and if you hadn't had him to start you,
you'd a taken it out in blowing.</p>

<p>"You didn't want to come.  The average man don't like trouble
and danger. YOU don't like trouble and danger.  But if only HALF
a man&mdash;like Buck Harkness, there&mdash;shouts 'Lynch him!
lynch him!' you're afraid to back down&mdash;afraid you'll be
found out to be what you are&mdash;COWARDS&mdash;and so you raise
a yell, and hang yourselves on to that half-a-man's coat-tail,
and come raging up here, swearing what big things you're going to
do. The pitifulest thing out is a mob; that's what an army
is&mdash;a mob; they don't fight with courage that's born in
them, but with courage that's borrowed from their mass, and from
their officers.  But a mob without any MAN at the head of it is
BENEATH pitifulness.  Now the thing for YOU to do is to droop
your tails and go home and crawl in a hole.  If any real
lynching's going to be done it will be done in the dark, Southern
fashion; and when they come they'll bring their masks, and fetch
a MAN along.  Now LEAVE&mdash;and take your half-a-man with
you"&mdash;tossing his gun up across his left arm and cocking it
when he says this.</p>

<p>The crowd washed back sudden, and then broke all apart, and
went tearing off every which way, and Buck Harkness he heeled it
after them, looking tolerable cheap.  I could a stayed if I
wanted to, but I didn't want to.</p>

<p>I went to the circus and loafed around the back side till the
watchman went by, and then dived in under the tent.  I had my
twenty-dollar gold piece and some other money, but I reckoned I
better save it, because there ain't no telling how soon you are
going to need it, away from home and amongst strangers that way.
 You can't be too careful.  I ain't opposed to spending money on
circuses when there ain't no other way, but there ain't no use in
WASTING it on them.</p>

<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>


<p>It was a real bully circus.  It was the splendidest sight that
ever was when they all come riding in, two and two, a gentleman
and lady, side by side, the men just in their drawers and
undershirts, and no shoes nor stirrups, and resting their hands
on their thighs easy and comfortable&mdash;there must a been
twenty of them&mdash;and every lady with a lovely complexion, and
perfectly beautiful, and looking just like a gang of real
sure-enough queens, and dressed in clothes that cost millions of
dollars, and just littered with diamonds.  It was a powerful fine
sight; I never see anything so lovely.  And then one by one they
got up and stood, and went a-weaving around the ring so gentle
and wavy and graceful, the men looking ever so tall and airy and
straight, with their heads bobbing and skimming along, away up
there under the tent-roof, and every lady's rose-leafy dress
flapping soft and silky around her hips, and she looking like the
most loveliest parasol.</p>

<p>And then faster and faster they went, all of them dancing,
first one foot out in the air and then the other, the horses
leaning more and more, and the ringmaster going round and round
the center-pole, cracking his whip and shouting "Hi!&mdash;hi!"
and the clown cracking jokes behind him; and by and by all hands
dropped the reins, and every lady put her knuckles on her hips
and every gentleman folded his arms, and then how the horses did
lean over and hump themselves!  And so one after the other they
all skipped off into the ring, and made the sweetest bow I ever
see, and then scampered out, and everybody clapped their hands
and went just about wild.</p>

<p>Well, all through the circus they done the most astonishing
things; and all the time that clown carried on so it most killed
the people.  The ringmaster couldn't ever say a word to him but
he was back at him quick as a wink with the funniest things a
body ever said; and how he ever COULD think of so many of them,
and so sudden and so pat, was what I couldn't noway understand.
Why, I couldn't a thought of them in a year. And by and by a
drunk man tried to get into the ring&mdash;said he wanted to
ride; said he could ride as well as anybody that ever was.  They
argued and tried to keep him out, but he wouldn't listen, and the
whole show come to a standstill.  Then the people begun to holler
at him and make fun of him, and that made him mad, and he begun
to rip and tear; so that stirred up the people, and a lot of men
begun to pile down off of the benches and swarm towards the ring,
saying, "Knock him down! throw him out!" and one or two women
begun to scream.  So, then, the ringmaster he made a little
speech, and said he hoped there wouldn't be no disturbance, and
if the man would promise he wouldn't make no more trouble he
would let him ride if he thought he could stay on the horse.  So
everybody laughed and said all right, and the man got on. The
minute he was on, the horse begun to rip and tear and jump and
cavort around, with two circus men hanging on to his bridle
trying to hold him, and the drunk man hanging on to his neck, and
his heels flying in the air every jump, and the whole crowd of
people standing up shouting and laughing till tears rolled down.
 And at last, sure enough, all the circus men could do, the horse
broke loose, and away he went like the very nation, round and
round the ring, with that sot laying down on him and hanging to
his neck, with first one leg hanging most to the ground on one
side, and then t'other one on t'other side, and the people just
crazy.  It warn't funny to me, though; I was all of a tremble to
see his danger.  But pretty soon he struggled up astraddle and
grabbed the bridle, a-reeling this way and that; and the next
minute he sprung up and dropped the bridle and stood! and the
horse a-going like a house afire too.  He just stood up there,
a-sailing around as easy and comfortable as if he warn't ever drunk
in his life&mdash;and then he begun to pull off his clothes and
sling them.  He shed them so thick they kind of clogged up the
air, and altogether he shed seventeen suits. And, then, there he
was, slim and handsome, and dressed the gaudiest and prettiest
you ever saw, and he lit into that horse with his whip and made
him fairly hum&mdash;and finally skipped off, and made his bow
and danced off to the dressing-room, and everybody just a-howling
with pleasure and astonishment.</p>

<br>
<br>

<p>Then the ringmaster he see how he had been fooled, and he WAS
the sickest ringmaster you ever see, I reckon.  Why, it was one
of his own men!  He had got up that joke all out of his own head,
and never let on to nobody. Well, I felt sheepish enough to be
took in so, but I wouldn't a been in that ringmaster's place, not
for a thousand dollars.  I don't know; there may be bullier
circuses than what that one was, but I never struck them yet.
Anyways, it was plenty good enough for ME; and wherever I run
across it, it can have all of MY custom every time.</p>

<p>Well, that night we had OUR show; but there warn't only about
twelve people there&mdash;just enough to pay expenses.  And they
laughed all the time, and that made the duke mad; and everybody
left, anyway, before the show was over, but one boy which was
asleep.  So the duke said these Arkansaw lunkheads couldn't come
up to Shakespeare; what they wanted was low comedy&mdash;and
maybe something ruther worse than low comedy, he reckoned.  He
said he could size their style.  So next morning he got some big
sheets of wrapping paper and some black paint, and drawed off
some handbills, and stuck them up all over the village.  The
bills said:</p>

CHAPTER XXIII.</p>

<p>WELL, all day him and the king was hard at it, rigging up a
stage and a curtain and a row of candles for footlights; and that
night the house was jam full of men in no time.  When the place
couldn't hold no more, the duke he quit tending door and went
around the back way and come on to the stage and stood up before
the curtain and made a little speech, and praised up this
tragedy, and said it was the most thrillingest one that ever was;
and so he went on a-bragging about the tragedy, and about Edmund
Kean the Elder, which was to play the main principal part in it;
and at last when he'd got everybody's expectations up high
enough, he rolled up the curtain, and the next minute the king
come a-prancing out on all fours, naked; and he was painted all
over, ring-streaked-and-striped, all sorts of colors, as
splendid as a rainbow.  And&mdash;but never mind the rest of his
outfit; it was just wild, but it was awful funny. The people most
killed themselves laughing; and when the king got done capering
and capered off behind the scenes, they roared and clapped and
stormed and haw-hawed till he come back and done it over again,
and after that they made him do it another time. Well, it would
make a cow laugh to see the shines that old idiot cut.</p>

<p>Then the duke he lets the curtain down, and bows to the
people, and says the great tragedy will be performed only two
nights more, on accounts of pressing London engagements, where
the seats is all sold already for it in Drury Lane; and then he
makes them another bow, and says if he has succeeded in pleasing
them and instructing them, he will be deeply obleeged if they
will mention it to their friends and get them to come and see
it.</p>

<p>Twenty people sings out:</p>

<p>"What, is it over?  Is that ALL?"</p>

<p>The duke says yes.  Then there was a fine time.  Everybody
sings out, "Sold!" and rose up mad, and was a-going for that
stage and them tragedians.  But a big, fine looking man jumps up
on a bench and shouts:</p>

<p>"Hold on!  Just a word, gentlemen."  They stopped to listen.
 "We are sold&mdash;mighty badly sold.  But we don't want to be
the laughing stock of this whole town, I reckon, and never hear
the last of this thing as long as we live.  NO.  What we want is
to go out of here quiet, and talk this show up, and sell the REST
of the town!  Then we'll all be in the same boat.  Ain't that
sensible?" ("You bet it is!&mdash;the jedge is right!" everybody
sings out.) "All right, then&mdash;not a word about any sell.  Go
along home, and advise everybody to come and see the
tragedy."</p>

<p>Next day you couldn't hear nothing around that town but how
splendid that show was.  House was jammed again that night, and
we sold this crowd the same way.  When me and the king and the
duke got home to the raft we all had a supper; and by and by,
about midnight, they made Jim and me back her out and float her
down the middle of the river, and fetch her in and hide her about
two mile below town.</p>

<p>The third night the house was crammed again&mdash;and they
warn't new-comers this time, but people that was at the show the
other two nights.  I stood by the duke at the door, and I see
that every man that went in had his pockets bulging, or something
muffled up under his coat&mdash;and I see it warn't no perfumery,
neither, not by a long sight.  I smelt sickly eggs by the barrel,
and rotten cabbages, and such things; and if I know the signs of
a dead cat being around, and I bet I do, there was sixty-four of
them went in.  I shoved in there for a minute, but it was too
various for me; I couldn't stand it.  Well, when the place
couldn't hold no more people the duke he give a fellow a quarter
and told him to tend door for him a minute, and then he started
around for the stage door, I after him; but the minute we turned
the corner and was in the dark he says:</p>

<p>"Walk fast now till you get away from the houses, and then
shin for the raft like the dickens was after you!"</p>

<p>I done it, and he done the same.  We struck the raft at the
same time, and in less than two seconds we was gliding down
stream, all dark and still, and edging towards the middle of the
river, nobody saying a word. I reckoned the poor king was in for
a gaudy time of it with the audience, but nothing of the sort;
pretty soon he crawls out from under the wigwam, and says:</p>

<p>"Well, how'd the old thing pan out this time, duke?"  He
hadn't been up-town at all.</p>

<p>We never showed a light till we was about ten mile below the
village. Then we lit up and had a supper, and the king and the
duke fairly laughed their bones loose over the way they'd served
them people.  The duke says:</p>

<p>"Greenhorns, flatheads!  I knew the first house would keep mum
and let the rest of the town get roped in; and I knew they'd lay
for us the third night, and consider it was THEIR turn now.
 Well, it IS their turn, and I'd give something to know how much
they'd take for it.  I WOULD just like to know how they're
putting in their opportunity.  They can turn it into a picnic if
they want to&mdash;they brought plenty provisions."</p>

<p>Them rapscallions took in four hundred and sixty-five dollars
in that three nights.  I never see money hauled in by the
wagon-load like that before.  By and by, when they was asleep and
snoring, Jim says:</p>

<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>


<p>"Don't it s'prise you de way dem kings carries on, Huck?"</p>

<p>"No," I says, "it don't."</p>

<p>"Why don't it, Huck?"</p>

<p>"Well, it don't, because it's in the breed.  I reckon they're
all alike,"</p>

<p>"But, Huck, dese kings o' ourn is reglar rapscallions; dat's
jist what dey is; dey's reglar rapscallions."</p>

<p>"Well, that's what I'm a-saying; all kings is mostly
rapscallions, as fur as I can make out."</p>

<p>"Is dat so?"</p>

<p>"You read about them once&mdash;you'll see.  Look at Henry the
Eight; this 'n 's a Sunday-school Superintendent to HIM.  And
look at Charles Second, and Louis Fourteen, and Louis Fifteen,
and James Second, and Edward Second, and Richard Third, and forty
more; besides all them Saxon heptarchies that used to rip around
so in old times and raise Cain.  My, you ought to seen old Henry
the Eight when he was in bloom.  He WAS a blossom.  He used to
marry a new wife every day, and chop off her head next morning.
 And he would do it just as indifferent as if he was ordering up
eggs.  'Fetch up Nell Gwynn,' he says.  They fetch her up. Next
morning, 'Chop off her head!'  And they chop it off.  'Fetch up
Jane Shore,' he says; and up she comes, Next morning, 'Chop off
her head'&mdash;and they chop it off.  'Ring up Fair Rosamun.'
 Fair Rosamun answers the bell.  Next morning, 'Chop off her
head.'  And he made every one of them tell him a tale every
night; and he kept that up till he had hogged a thousand and one
tales that way, and then he put them all in a book, and called it
Domesday Book&mdash;which was a good name and stated the case.
 You don't know kings, Jim, but I know them; and this old rip of
ourn is one of the cleanest I've struck in history.  Well, Henry
he takes a notion he wants to get up some trouble with this
country. How does he go at it&mdash;give notice?&mdash;give the
country a show?  No.  All of a sudden he heaves all the tea in
Boston Harbor overboard, and whacks out a declaration of
independence, and dares them to come on.  That was HIS
style&mdash;he never give anybody a chance.  He had suspicions of
his father, the Duke of Wellington.  Well, what did he do?  Ask
him to show up?  No&mdash;drownded him in a butt of mamsey, like
a cat.  S'pose people left money laying around where he
was&mdash;what did he do?  He collared it.  S'pose he contracted
to do a thing, and you paid him, and didn't set down there and
see that he done it&mdash;what did he do?  He always done the
other thing. S'pose he opened his mouth&mdash;what then?  If he
didn't shut it up powerful quick he'd lose a lie every time.
 That's the kind of a bug Henry was; and if we'd a had him along
'stead of our kings he'd a fooled that town a heap worse than
ourn done.  I don't say that ourn is lambs, because they ain't,
when you come right down to the cold facts; but they ain't
nothing to THAT old ram, anyway.  All I say is, kings is kings,
and you got to make allowances.  Take them all around, they're a
mighty ornery lot. It's the way they're raised."</p>

<br>


<p>"But dis one do SMELL so like de nation, Huck."</p>

<p>"Well, they all do, Jim.  We can't help the way a king smells;
history don't tell no way."</p>

<p>"Now de duke, he's a tolerble likely man in some ways."</p>

<p>"Yes, a duke's different.  But not very different.  This one's
a middling hard lot for a duke.  When he's drunk there ain't no
near-sighted man could tell him from a king."</p>

<p>"Well, anyways, I doan' hanker for no mo' un um, Huck.  Dese
is all I kin stan'."</p>

<p>"It's the way I feel, too, Jim.  But we've got them on our
hands, and we got to remember what they are, and make allowances.
 Sometimes I wish we could hear of a country that's out of
kings."</p>

<p>What was the use to tell Jim these warn't real kings and
dukes?  It wouldn't a done no good; and, besides, it was just as
I said:  you couldn't tell them from the real kind.</p>

<p>I went to sleep, and Jim didn't call me when it was my turn.
 He often done that.  When I waked up just at daybreak he was
sitting there with his head down betwixt his knees, moaning and
mourning to himself.  I didn't take notice nor let on.  I knowed
what it was about.  He was thinking about his wife and his
children, away up yonder, and he was low and homesick; because he
hadn't ever been away from home before in his life; and I do
believe he cared just as much for his people as white folks does
for their'n.  It don't seem natural, but I reckon it's so.  He
was often moaning and mourning that way nights, when he judged I
was asleep, and saying, "Po' little 'Lizabeth! po' little Johnny!
it's mighty hard; I spec' I ain't ever gwyne to see you no mo',
no mo'!"  He was a mighty good nigger, Jim was.</p>

<p>But this time I somehow got to talking to him about his wife
and young ones; and by and by he says:</p>

<p>"What makes me feel so bad dis time 'uz bekase I hear sumpn
over yonder on de bank like a whack, er a slam, while ago, en it
mine me er de time I treat my little 'Lizabeth so ornery.  She
warn't on'y 'bout fo' year ole, en she tuck de sk'yarlet fever,
en had a powful rough spell; but she got well, en one day she was
a-stannin' aroun', en I says to her, I says:</p>

<p>"'Shet de do'.'</p>

<p>"She never done it; jis' stood dah, kiner smilin' up at me.
 It make me mad; en I says agin, mighty loud, I says:</p>

<p>"'Doan' you hear me?  Shet de do'!'</p>

<p>"She jis stood de same way, kiner smilin' up.  I was a-bilin'!
 I says:</p>

<p>"'I lay I MAKE you mine!'</p>

<p>"En wid dat I fetch' her a slap side de head dat sont her
a-sprawlin'. Den I went into de yuther room, en 'uz gone 'bout
ten minutes; en when I come back dah was dat do' a-stannin' open
YIT, en dat chile stannin' mos' right in it, a-lookin' down and
mournin', en de tears runnin' down.  My, but I WUZ mad!  I was
a-gwyne for de chile, but jis' den&mdash;it was a do' dat open
innerds&mdash;jis' den, 'long come de wind en slam it to, behine

could yell.  SHE NEVER BUDGE!  Oh, Huck, I bust out a-cryin' en
grab her up in my arms, en say, 'Oh, de po' little thing!  De
Lord God Amighty fogive po' ole Jim, kaze he never gwyne to
fogive hisself as long's he live!'  Oh, she was plumb deef en

CHAPTER XXIV.</p>

<p>NEXT day, towards night, we laid up under a little willow
towhead out in the middle, where there was a village on each side
of the river, and the duke and the king begun to lay out a plan
for working them towns.  Jim he spoke to the duke, and said he
hoped it wouldn't take but a few hours, because it got mighty
heavy and tiresome to him when he had to lay all day in the
wigwam tied with the rope.  You see, when we left him all alone
we had to tie him, because if anybody happened on to him all by
himself and not tied it wouldn't look much like he was a runaway
nigger, you know. So the duke said it WAS kind of hard to have to
lay roped all day, and he'd cipher out some way to get around
it.</p>

<p>He was uncommon bright, the duke was, and he soon struck it.
 He dressed Jim up in King Lear's outfit&mdash;it was a long
curtain-calico gown, and a white horse-hair wig and whiskers; and
then he took his theater paint and painted Jim's face and hands
and ears and neck all over a dead, dull, solid blue, like a man
that's been drownded nine days.  Blamed if he warn't the
horriblest looking outrage I ever see.  Then the duke took and
wrote out a sign on a shingle so:</p>

<p>Sick Arab&mdash;but harmless when not out of his head.</p>

<p>And he nailed that shingle to a lath, and stood the lath up
four or five foot in front of the wigwam.  Jim was satisfied.  He
said it was a sight better than lying tied a couple of years
every day, and trembling all over every time there was a sound.
 The duke told him to make himself free and easy, and if anybody
ever come meddling around, he must hop out of the wigwam, and
carry on a little, and fetch a howl or two like a wild beast, and
he reckoned they would light out and leave him alone.  Which was
sound enough judgment; but you take the average man, and he
wouldn't wait for him to howl.  Why, he didn't only look like he
was dead, he looked considerable more than that.</p>

<p>These rapscallions wanted to try the Nonesuch again, because
there was so much money in it, but they judged it wouldn't be
safe, because maybe the news might a worked along down by this
time.  They couldn't hit no project that suited exactly; so at
last the duke said he reckoned he'd lay off and work his brains
an hour or two and see if he couldn't put up something on the
Arkansaw village; and the king he allowed he would drop over to
t'other village without any plan, but just trust in Providence to
lead him the profitable way&mdash;meaning the devil, I reckon.
 We had all bought store clothes where we stopped last; and now
the king put his'n on, and he told me to put mine on.  I done it,
of course.  The king's duds was all black, and he did look real
swell and starchy.  I never knowed how clothes could change a
body before.  Why, before, he looked like the orneriest old rip
that ever was; but now, when he'd take off his new white beaver
and make a bow and do a smile, he looked that grand and good and
pious that you'd say he had walked right out of the ark, and
maybe was old Leviticus himself.  Jim cleaned up the canoe, and I
got my paddle ready.  There was a big steamboat laying at the
shore away up under the point, about three mile above the
town&mdash;been there a couple of hours, taking on freight.  Says
the king:</p>

<p>"Seein' how I'm dressed, I reckon maybe I better arrive down
from St. Louis or Cincinnati, or some other big place.  Go for
the steamboat, Huckleberry; we'll come down to the village on
her."</p>

<p>I didn't have to be ordered twice to go and take a steamboat
ride.  I fetched the shore a half a mile above the village, and
then went scooting along the bluff bank in the easy water.
 Pretty soon we come to a nice innocent-looking young country
jake setting on a log swabbing the sweat off of his face, for it
was powerful warm weather; and he had a couple of big carpet-bags
by him.</p>

<p>"Run her nose in shore," says the king.  I done it.  "Wher'
you bound for, young man?"</p>

<p>"For the steamboat; going to Orleans."</p>

<p>"Git aboard," says the king.  "Hold on a minute, my servant
'll he'p you with them bags.  Jump out and he'p the gentleman,
Adolphus"&mdash;meaning me, I see.</p>

<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

<p>I done so, and then we all three started on again.  The young
chap was mighty thankful; said it was tough work toting his
baggage such weather. He asked the king where he was going, and
the king told him he'd come down the river and landed at the
other village this morning, and now he was going up a few mile to
see an old friend on a farm up there.  The young fellow says:</p>

<p>"When I first see you I says to myself, 'It's Mr. Wilks, sure,
and he come mighty near getting here in time.'  But then I says
again, 'No, I reckon it ain't him, or else he wouldn't be
paddling up the river.'  You AIN'T him, are you?"</p>

<p>"No, my name's Blodgett&mdash;Elexander
Blodgett&mdash;REVEREND Elexander Blodgett, I s'pose I must say,
as I'm one o' the Lord's poor servants.  But still I'm jist as
able to be sorry for Mr. Wilks for not arriving in time, all the
same, if he's missed anything by it&mdash;which I hope he
hasn't."</p>

<p>"Well, he don't miss any property by it, because he'll get
that all right; but he's missed seeing his brother Peter
die&mdash;which he mayn't mind, nobody can tell as to
that&mdash;but his brother would a give anything in this world to
see HIM before he died; never talked about nothing else all these
three weeks; hadn't seen him since they was boys
together&mdash;and hadn't ever seen his brother William at
all&mdash;that's the deef and dumb one&mdash;William ain't more
than thirty or thirty-five.  Peter and George were the only ones
that come out here; George was the married brother; him and his
wife both died last year.  Harvey and William's the only ones
that's left now; and, as I was saying, they haven't got here in
time."</p>

<p>"Did anybody send 'em word?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes; a month or two ago, when Peter was first took;
because Peter said then that he sorter felt like he warn't going
to get well this time. You see, he was pretty old, and George's
g'yirls was too young to be much company for him, except Mary
Jane, the red-headed one; and so he was kinder lonesome after
George and his wife died, and didn't seem to care much to live.
 He most desperately wanted to see Harvey&mdash;and William, too,
for that matter&mdash;because he was one of them kind that can't
bear to make a will.  He left a letter behind for Harvey, and
said he'd told in it where his money was hid, and how he wanted
the rest of the property divided up so George's g'yirls would be
all right&mdash;for George didn't leave nothing.  And that letter
was all they could get him to put a pen to."</p>

<p>"Why do you reckon Harvey don't come?  Wher' does he
live?"</p>

<p>"Oh, he lives in England&mdash;Sheffield&mdash;preaches
there&mdash;hasn't ever been in this country.  He hasn't had any
too much time&mdash;and besides he mightn't a got the letter at
all, you know."</p>

<p>"Too bad, too bad he couldn't a lived to see his brothers,
poor soul. You going to Orleans, you say?"</p>

<p>"Yes, but that ain't only a part of it.  I'm going in a ship,
next Wednesday, for Ryo Janeero, where my uncle lives."</p>

<p>"It's a pretty long journey.  But it'll be lovely; wisht I was
a-going. Is Mary Jane the oldest?  How old is the others?"</p>

<p>"Mary Jane's nineteen, Susan's fifteen, and Joanna's about
fourteen&mdash;that's the one that gives herself to good works
and has a hare-lip."</p>

<p>"Poor things! to be left alone in the cold world so."</p>

<p>"Well, they could be worse off.  Old Peter had friends, and
they ain't going to let them come to no harm.  There's Hobson,
the Babtis' preacher; and Deacon Lot Hovey, and Ben Rucker, and
Abner Shackleford, and Levi Bell, the lawyer; and Dr. Robinson,
and their wives, and the widow Bartley, and&mdash;well, there's a
lot of them; but these are the ones that Peter was thickest with,
and used to write about sometimes, when he wrote home; so Harvey
'll know where to look for friends when he gets here."</p>

</center>

<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

<p>Well, the old man went on asking questions till he just fairly
emptied that young fellow.  Blamed if he didn't inquire about
everybody and everything in that blessed town, and all about the
Wilkses; and about Peter's business&mdash;which was a tanner; and
about George's&mdash;which was a carpenter; and about
Harvey's&mdash;which was a dissentering minister; and so on, and
so on.  Then he says:</p>

<p>"What did you want to walk all the way up to the steamboat
for?"</p>

<p>"Because she's a big Orleans boat, and I was afeard she
mightn't stop there.  When they're deep they won't stop for a
hail.  A Cincinnati boat will, but this is a St. Louis one."</p>

<p>"Was Peter Wilks well off?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, pretty well off.  He had houses and land, and it's
reckoned he left three or four thousand in cash hid up
som'ers."</p>

<p>"When did you say he died?"</p>

<p>"I didn't say, but it was last night."</p>

<p>"Funeral to-morrow, likely?"</p>

<p>"Yes, 'bout the middle of the day."</p>

<p>"Well, it's all terrible sad; but we've all got to go, one
time or another. So what we want to do is to be prepared; then
we're all right."</p>

<p>"Yes, sir, it's the best way.  Ma used to always say
that."</p>

<p>When we struck the boat she was about done loading, and pretty
soon she got off.  The king never said nothing about going
aboard, so I lost my ride, after all.  When the boat was gone the
king made me paddle up another mile to a lonesome place, and then
he got ashore and says:</p>

<p>"Now hustle back, right off, and fetch the duke up here, and
the new carpet-bags.  And if he's gone over to t'other side, go
over there and git him.  And tell him to git himself up
regardless.  Shove along, now."</p>

<p>I see what HE was up to; but I never said nothing, of course.
 When I got back with the duke we hid the canoe, and then they
set down on a log, and the king told him everything, just like
the young fellow had said it&mdash;every last word of it.  And
all the time he was a-doing it he tried to talk like an
Englishman; and he done it pretty well, too, for a slouch. I
can't imitate him, and so I ain't a-going to try to; but he
really done it pretty good.  Then he says:</p>

<p>"How are you on the deef and dumb, Bilgewater?"</p>

<p>The duke said, leave him alone for that; said he had played a
deef and dumb person on the histronic boards.  So then they
waited for a steamboat.</p>

<p>About the middle of the afternoon a couple of little boats
come along, but they didn't come from high enough up the river;
but at last there was a big one, and they hailed her.  She sent
out her yawl, and we went aboard, and she was from Cincinnati;
and when they found we only wanted to go four or five mile they
was booming mad, and gave us a cussing, and said they wouldn't
land us.  But the king was ca'm.  He says:</p>

<p>"If gentlemen kin afford to pay a dollar a mile apiece to be
took on and put off in a yawl, a steamboat kin afford to carry
'em, can't it?"</p>

<p>So they softened down and said it was all right; and when we
got to the village they yawled us ashore.  About two dozen men
flocked down when they see the yawl a-coming, and when the king
says:</p>

<p>"Kin any of you gentlemen tell me wher' Mr. Peter Wilks
lives?" they give a glance at one another, and nodded their
heads, as much as to say, "What d' I tell you?"  Then one of them
says, kind of soft and gentle:</p>

<p>"I'm sorry sir, but the best we can do is to tell you where he
DID live yesterday evening."</p>

<p>Sudden as winking the ornery old cretur went an to smash, and
fell up against the man, and put his chin on his shoulder, and
cried down his back, and says:</p>

<p>"Alas, alas, our poor brother&mdash;gone, and we never got to
see him; oh, it's too, too hard!"</p>

<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>


<p>Then he turns around, blubbering, and makes a lot of idiotic
signs to the duke on his hands, and blamed if he didn't drop a
carpet-bag and bust out a-crying.  If they warn't the beatenest
lot, them two frauds, that ever I struck.</p>

<p>Well, the men gathered around and sympathized with them, and
said all sorts of kind things to them, and carried their
carpet-bags up the hill for them, and let them lean on them and
cry, and told the king all about his brother's last moments, and
the king he told it all over again on his hands to the duke, and
both of them took on about that dead tanner like they'd lost the
twelve disciples.  Well, if ever I struck anything like it, I'm a
nigger. It was enough to make a body ashamed of the human
race.</p>

CHAPTER XXV.</p>

<p>THE news was all over town in two minutes, and you could see
the people tearing down on the run from every which way, some of
them putting on their coats as they come.  Pretty soon we was in
the middle of a crowd, and the noise of the tramping was like a
soldier march.  The windows and dooryards was full; and every
minute somebody would say, over a fence:</p>

<p>"Is it THEM?"</p>

<p>And somebody trotting along with the gang would answer back
and say:</p>

<p>"You bet it is."</p>

<p>When we got to the house the street in front of it was packed,
and the three girls was standing in the door.  Mary Jane WAS
red-headed, but that don't make no difference, she was most awful
beautiful, and her face and her eyes was all lit up like glory,
she was so glad her uncles was come. The king he spread his arms,
and Mary Jane she jumped for them, and the hare-lip jumped for
the duke, and there they HAD it!  Everybody most, leastways
women, cried for joy to see them meet again at last and have such
good times.</p>

<p>Then the king he hunched the duke private&mdash;I see him do
it&mdash;and then he looked around and see the coffin, over in
the corner on two chairs; so then him and the duke, with a hand
across each other's shoulder, and t'other hand to their eyes,
walked slow and solemn over there, everybody dropping back to
give them room, and all the talk and noise stopping, people
saying "Sh!" and all the men taking their hats off and drooping
their heads, so you could a heard a pin fall.  And when they got
there they bent over and looked in the coffin, and took one
sight, and then they bust out a-crying so you could a heard them
to Orleans, most; and then they put their arms around each
other's necks, and hung their chins over each other's shoulders;
and then for three minutes, or maybe four, I never see two men
leak the way they done.  And, mind you, everybody was doing the
same; and the place was that damp I never see anything like it.
Then one of them got on one side of the coffin, and t'other on
t'other side, and they kneeled down and rested their foreheads on
the coffin, and let on to pray all to themselves.  Well, when it
come to that it worked the crowd like you never see anything like
it, and everybody broke down and went to sobbing right out
loud&mdash;the poor girls, too; and every woman, nearly, went up
to the girls, without saying a word, and kissed them, solemn, on
the forehead, and then put their hand on their head, and looked
up towards the sky, with the tears running down, and then busted
out and went off sobbing and swabbing, and give the next woman a
show.  I never see anything so disgusting.</p>

</center>

<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>


<p>Well, by and by the king he gets up and comes forward a
little, and works himself up and slobbers out a speech, all full
of tears and flapdoodle about its being a sore trial for him and
his poor brother to lose the diseased, and to miss seeing
diseased alive after the long journey of four thousand mile, but
it's a trial that's sweetened and sanctified to us by this dear
sympathy and these holy tears, and so he thanks them out of his
heart and out of his brother's heart, because out of their mouths
they can't, words being too weak and cold, and all that kind of
rot and slush, till it was just sickening; and then he blubbers
out a pious goody-goody Amen, and turns himself loose and goes to
crying fit to bust.</p>

<p>And the minute the words were out of his mouth somebody over
in the crowd struck up the doxolojer, and everybody joined in
with all their might, and it just warmed you up and made you feel
as good as church letting out. Music is a good thing; and after
all that soul-butter and hogwash I never see it freshen up things
so, and sound so honest and bully.</p>

<p>Then the king begins to work his jaw again, and says how him
and his nieces would be glad if a few of the main principal
friends of the family would take supper here with them this
evening, and help set up with the ashes of the diseased; and says
if his poor brother laying yonder could speak he knows who he
would name, for they was names that was very dear to him, and
mentioned often in his letters; and so he will name the same, to
wit, as follows, vizz.:&mdash;Rev. Mr. Hobson, and Deacon Lot
Hovey, and Mr. Ben Rucker, and Abner Shackleford, and Levi Bell,
and Dr. Robinson, and their wives, and the widow Bartley.</p>

<p>Rev. Hobson and Dr. Robinson was down to the end of the town
a-hunting together&mdash;that is, I mean the doctor was shipping
a sick man to t'other world, and the preacher was pinting him
right.  Lawyer Bell was away up to Louisville on business.  But
the rest was on hand, and so they all come and shook hands with
the king and thanked him and talked to him; and then they shook
hands with the duke and didn't say nothing, but just kept
a-smiling and bobbing their heads like a passel of sapheads
whilst he made all sorts of signs with his hands and said
"Goo-goo&mdash;goo-goo-goo" all the time, like a baby that can't
talk.</p>

<p>So the king he blattered along, and managed to inquire about
pretty much everybody and dog in town, by his name, and mentioned
all sorts of little things that happened one time or another in
the town, or to George's family, or to Peter.  And he always let
on that Peter wrote him the things; but that was a lie:  he got
every blessed one of them out of that young flathead that we
canoed up to the steamboat.</p>

<p>Then Mary Jane she fetched the letter her father left behind,
and the king he read it out loud and cried over it.  It give the
dwelling-house and three thousand dollars, gold, to the girls;
and it give the tanyard (which was doing a good business), along
with some other houses and land (worth about seven thousand), and
three thousand dollars in gold to Harvey and William, and told
where the six thousand cash was hid down cellar.  So these two
frauds said they'd go and fetch it up, and have everything square
and above-board; and told me to come with a candle.  We shut the
cellar door behind us, and when they found the bag they spilt it
out on the floor, and it was a lovely sight, all them
yaller-boys.  My, the way the king's eyes did shine!  He slaps
the duke on the shoulder and says:</p>

<p>"Oh, THIS ain't bully nor noth'n!  Oh, no, I reckon not!  Why,
Biljy, it beats the Nonesuch, DON'T it?"</p>

<p>The duke allowed it did.  They pawed the yaller-boys, and
sifted them through their fingers and let them jingle down on the
floor; and the king says:</p>

<p>"It ain't no use talkin'; bein' brothers to a rich dead man
and representatives of furrin heirs that's got left is the line
for you and me, Bilge.  Thish yer comes of trust'n to Providence.
 It's the best way, in the long run.  I've tried 'em all, and
ther' ain't no better way."</p>

<p>Most everybody would a been satisfied with the pile, and took
it on trust; but no, they must count it.  So they counts it, and
it comes out four hundred and fifteen dollars short.  Says the
king:</p>

<p>"Dern him, I wonder what he done with that four hundred and
fifteen dollars?"</p>

<p>They worried over that awhile, and ransacked all around for
it.  Then the duke says:</p>

<p>"Well, he was a pretty sick man, and likely he made a
mistake&mdash;I reckon that's the way of it.  The best way's to
let it go, and keep still about it.  We can spare it."</p>

<p>"Oh, shucks, yes, we can SPARE it.  I don't k'yer noth'n 'bout
that&mdash;it's the COUNT I'm thinkin' about.  We want to be
awful square and open and above-board here, you know.  We want to
lug this h-yer money up stairs and count it before
everybody&mdash;then ther' ain't noth'n suspicious.  But when the
dead man says ther's six thous'n dollars, you know, we don't want
to&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Hold on," says the duke.  "Le's make up the deffisit," and he
begun to haul out yaller-boys out of his pocket.</p>

<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>


<p>"It's a most amaz'n' good idea, duke&mdash;you HAVE got a
rattlin' clever head on you," says the king.  "Blest if the old
Nonesuch ain't a heppin' us out agin," and HE begun to haul out
yaller-jackets and stack them up.</p>

<p>It most busted them, but they made up the six thousand clean
and clear.</p>

<p>"Say," says the duke, "I got another idea.  Le's go up stairs
and count this money, and then take and GIVE IT TO THE
GIRLS."</p>

<p>"Good land, duke, lemme hug you!  It's the most dazzling idea
'at ever a man struck.  You have cert'nly got the most
astonishin' head I ever see. Oh, this is the boss dodge, ther'
ain't no mistake 'bout it.  Let 'em fetch along their suspicions
now if they want to&mdash;this 'll lay 'em out."</p>

<p>When we got up-stairs everybody gethered around the table, and
the king he counted it and stacked it up, three hundred dollars
in a pile&mdash;twenty elegant little piles.  Everybody looked
hungry at it, and licked their chops.  Then they raked it into
the bag again, and I see the king begin to swell himself up for
another speech.  He says:</p>

<p>"Friends all, my poor brother that lays yonder has done
generous by them that's left behind in the vale of sorrers.  He
has done generous by these yer poor little lambs that he loved
and sheltered, and that's left fatherless and motherless.  Yes,
and we that knowed him knows that he would a done MORE generous
by 'em if he hadn't ben afeard o' woundin' his dear William and
me.  Now, WOULDN'T he?  Ther' ain't no question 'bout it in MY
mind.  Well, then, what kind o' brothers would it be that 'd
stand in his way at sech a time?  And what kind o' uncles would
it be that 'd rob&mdash;yes, ROB&mdash;sech poor sweet lambs as
these 'at he loved so at sech a time?  If I know
William&mdash;and I THINK I do&mdash;he&mdash;well, I'll jest ask
him." He turns around and begins to make a lot of signs to the
duke with his hands, and the duke he looks at him stupid and
leather-headed a while; then all of a sudden he seems to catch
his meaning, and jumps for the king, goo-gooing with all his
might for joy, and hugs him about fifteen times before he lets
up.  Then the king says, "I knowed it; I reckon THAT 'll convince
anybody the way HE feels about it.  Here, Mary Jane, Susan,
Joanner, take the money&mdash;take it ALL.  It's the gift of him
that lays yonder, cold but joyful."</p>

<br>


<p>Mary Jane she went for him, Susan and the hare-lip went for
the duke, and then such another hugging and kissing I never see
yet.  And everybody crowded up with the tears in their eyes, and
most shook the hands off of them frauds, saying all the time:</p>

<p>"You DEAR good souls!&mdash;how LOVELY!&mdash;how COULD
you!"</p>

<p>Well, then, pretty soon all hands got to talking about the
diseased again, and how good he was, and what a loss he was, and
all that; and before long a big iron-jawed man worked himself in
there from outside, and stood a-listening and looking, and not
saying anything; and nobody saying anything to him either,
because the king was talking and they was all busy listening.
 The king was saying&mdash;in the middle of something he'd
started in on&mdash;</p>

<p>"&mdash;they bein' partickler friends o' the diseased.  That's
why they're invited here this evenin'; but tomorrow we want ALL
to come&mdash;everybody; for he respected everybody, he liked
everybody, and so it's fitten that his funeral orgies sh'd be
public."</p>

<p>And so he went a-mooning on and on, liking to hear himself
talk, and every little while he fetched in his funeral orgies
again, till the duke he couldn't stand it no more; so he writes
on a little scrap of paper, "OBSEQUIES, you old fool," and folds
it up, and goes to goo-gooing and reaching it over people's heads
to him.  The king he reads it and puts it in his pocket, and
says:</p>

<p>"Poor William, afflicted as he is, his HEART'S aluz right.
 Asks me to invite everybody to come to the funeral&mdash;wants
me to make 'em all welcome.  But he needn't a worried&mdash;it
was jest what I was at."</p>

<p>Then he weaves along again, perfectly ca'm, and goes to
dropping in his funeral orgies again every now and then, just
like he done before.  And when he done it the third time he
says:</p>

<p>"I say orgies, not because it's the common term, because it
ain't&mdash;obsequies bein' the common term&mdash;but because
orgies is the right term. Obsequies ain't used in England no more
now&mdash;it's gone out.  We say orgies now in England.  Orgies
is better, because it means the thing you're after more exact.
 It's a word that's made up out'n the Greek ORGO, outside, open,
abroad; and the Hebrew JEESUM, to plant, cover up; hence inTER.
 So, you see, funeral orgies is an open er public funeral."</p>

<p>He was the WORST I ever struck.  Well, the iron-jawed man he
laughed right in his face.  Everybody was shocked.  Everybody
says, "Why, DOCTOR!" and Abner Shackleford says:</p>

<p>"Why, Robinson, hain't you heard the news?  This is Harvey
Wilks."</p>

<p>The king he smiled eager, and shoved out his flapper, and
says:</p>

<p>"Is it my poor brother's dear good friend and physician?
 I&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Keep your hands off of me!" says the doctor.  "YOU talk like
an Englishman, DON'T you?  It's the worst imitation I ever heard.
 YOU Peter Wilks's brother!  You're a fraud, that's what you
are!"</p>

<p>Well, how they all took on!  They crowded around the doctor
and tried to quiet him down, and tried to explain to him and tell
him how Harvey 'd showed in forty ways that he WAS Harvey, and
knowed everybody by name, and the names of the very dogs, and
begged and BEGGED him not to hurt Harvey's feelings and the poor
girl's feelings, and all that.  But it warn't no use; he stormed
right along, and said any man that pretended to be an Englishman
and couldn't imitate the lingo no better than what he did was a
fraud and a liar.  The poor girls was hanging to the king and
crying; and all of a sudden the doctor ups and turns on THEM.  He
says:</p>

<p>"I was your father's friend, and I'm your friend; and I warn
you as a friend, and an honest one that wants to protect you and
keep you out of harm and trouble, to turn your backs on that
scoundrel and have nothing to do with him, the ignorant tramp,
with his idiotic Greek and Hebrew, as he calls it.  He is the
thinnest kind of an impostor&mdash;has come here with a lot of
empty names and facts which he picked up somewheres, and you take
them for PROOFS, and are helped to fool yourselves by these
foolish friends here, who ought to know better.  Mary Jane Wilks,
you know me for your friend, and for your unselfish friend, too.
 Now listen to me; turn this pitiful rascal out&mdash;I BEG you
to do it.  Will you?"</p>

<p>Mary Jane straightened herself up, and my, but she was
handsome!  She says:</p>

<p>"HERE is my answer."  She hove up the bag of money and put it
in the king's hands, and says, "Take this six thousand dollars,
and invest for me and my sisters any way you want to, and don't
give us no receipt for it."</p>

<p>Then she put her arm around the king on one side, and Susan
and the hare-lip done the same on the other.  Everybody clapped
their hands and stomped on the floor like a perfect storm, whilst
the king held up his head and smiled proud.  The doctor says:</p>

<p>"All right; I wash MY hands of the matter.  But I warn you all
that a time 's coming when you're going to feel sick whenever you
think of this day." And away he went.</p>

<p>"All right, doctor," says the king, kinder mocking him; "we'll
try and get 'em to send for you;" which made them all laugh, and
they said it was a prime good hit.</p>
