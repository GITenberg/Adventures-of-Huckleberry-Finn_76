CHAPTER XVI.</p>

<p>WE slept most all day, and started out at night, a little ways
behind a monstrous long raft that was as long going by as a
procession.  She had four long sweeps at each end, so we judged
she carried as many as thirty men, likely.  She had five big
wigwams aboard, wide apart, and an open camp fire in the middle,
and a tall flag-pole at each end.  There was a power of style
about her.  It AMOUNTED to something being a raftsman on such a
craft as that.</p>

<p>We went drifting down into a big bend, and the night clouded
up and got hot.  The river was very wide, and was walled with
solid timber on both sides; you couldn't see a break in it hardly
ever, or a light.  We talked about Cairo, and wondered whether we
would know it when we got to it.  I said likely we wouldn't,
because I had heard say there warn't but about a dozen houses
there, and if they didn't happen to have them lit up, how was we
going to know we was passing a town?  Jim said if the two big
rivers joined together there, that would show.  But I said maybe
we might think we was passing the foot of an island and coming
into the same old river again. That disturbed Jim&mdash;and me
too.  So the question was, what to do?  I said, paddle ashore the
first time a light showed, and tell them pap was behind, coming
along with a trading-scow, and was a green hand at the business,
and wanted to know how far it was to Cairo.  Jim thought it was a
good idea, so we took a smoke on it and waited.</p>

<p>There warn't nothing to do now but to look out sharp for the
town, and not pass it without seeing it.  He said he'd be mighty
sure to see it, because he'd be a free man the minute he seen it,
but if he missed it he'd be in a slave country again and no more
show for freedom.  Every little while he jumps up and says:</p>

<p>"Dah she is?"</p>

<p>But it warn't.  It was Jack-o'-lanterns, or lightning bugs; so
he set down again, and went to watching, same as before.  Jim
said it made him all over trembly and feverish to be so close to
freedom.  Well, I can tell you it made me all over trembly and
feverish, too, to hear him, because I begun to get it through my
head that he WAS most free&mdash;and who was to blame for it?
 Why, ME.  I couldn't get that out of my conscience, no how nor
no way. It got to troubling me so I couldn't rest; I couldn't
stay still in one place.  It hadn't ever come home to me before,
what this thing was that I was doing.  But now it did; and it
stayed with me, and scorched me more and more.  I tried to make
out to myself that I warn't to blame, because I didn't run Jim
off from his rightful owner; but it warn't no use, conscience up
and says, every time, "But you knowed he was running for his
freedom, and you could a paddled ashore and told somebody."  That
was so&mdash;I couldn't get around that noway.  That was where it
pinched.  Conscience says to me, "What had poor Miss Watson done
to you that you could see her nigger go off right under your eyes
and never say one single word?  What did that poor old woman do
to you that you could treat her so mean?  Why, she tried to learn
you your book, she tried to learn you your manners, she tried to
be good to you every way she knowed how.  THAT'S what she
done."</p>

<p>I got to feeling so mean and so miserable I most wished I was
dead.  I fidgeted up and down the raft, abusing myself to myself,
and Jim was fidgeting up and down past me.  We neither of us
could keep still.  Every time he danced around and says, "Dah's
Cairo!" it went through me like a shot, and I thought if it WAS
Cairo I reckoned I would die of miserableness.</p>

<p>Jim talked out loud all the time while I was talking to
myself.  He was saying how the first thing he would do when he
got to a free State he would go to saving up money and never
spend a single cent, and when he got enough he would buy his
wife, which was owned on a farm close to where Miss Watson lived;
and then they would both work to buy the two children, and if
their master wouldn't sell them, they'd get an Ab'litionist to go
and steal them.</p>

<p>It most froze me to hear such talk.  He wouldn't ever dared to
talk such talk in his life before.  Just see what a difference it
made in him the minute he judged he was about free.  It was
according to the old saying, "Give a nigger an inch and he'll
take an ell."  Thinks I, this is what comes of my not thinking.
 Here was this nigger, which I had as good as helped to run away,
coming right out flat-footed and saying he would steal his
children&mdash;children that belonged to a man I didn't even
know; a man that hadn't ever done me no harm.</p>

<p>I was sorry to hear Jim say that, it was such a lowering of
him.  My conscience got to stirring me up hotter than ever, until
at last I says to it, "Let up on me&mdash;it ain't too late
yet&mdash;I'll paddle ashore at the first light and tell."  I
felt easy and happy and light as a feather right off.  All my
troubles was gone.  I went to looking out sharp for a light, and
sort of singing to myself.  By and by one showed.  Jim sings
out:</p>

<p>"We's safe, Huck, we's safe!  Jump up and crack yo' heels!
 Dat's de good ole Cairo at las', I jis knows it!"</p>

<p>I says:</p>

<p>"I'll take the canoe and go and see, Jim.  It mightn't be, you
know."</p>

<p>He jumped and got the canoe ready, and put his old coat in the
bottom for me to set on, and give me the paddle; and as I shoved
off, he says:</p>

<p>"Pooty soon I'll be a-shout'n' for joy, en I'll say, it's all
on accounts o' Huck; I's a free man, en I couldn't ever ben free
ef it hadn' ben for Huck; Huck done it.  Jim won't ever forgit
you, Huck; you's de bes' fren' Jim's ever had; en you's de ONLY
fren' ole Jim's got now."</p>

<p>I was paddling off, all in a sweat to tell on him; but when he
says this, it seemed to kind of take the tuck all out of me.  I
went along slow then, and I warn't right down certain whether I
was glad I started or whether I warn't.  When I was fifty yards
off, Jim says:</p>

<p>"Dah you goes, de ole true Huck; de on'y white genlman dat
ever kep' his promise to ole Jim."</p>

<p>Well, I just felt sick.  But I says, I GOT to do it&mdash;I
can't get OUT of it.  Right then along comes a skiff with two men
in it with guns, and they stopped and I stopped.  One of them
says:</p>

<p>"What's that yonder?"</p>

<p>"A piece of a raft," I says.</p>

<p>"Do you belong on it?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"Any men on it?"</p>

<p>"Only one, sir."</p>

<p>"Well, there's five niggers run off to-night up yonder, above
the head of the bend.  Is your man white or black?"</p>

<p>I didn't answer up prompt.  I tried to, but the words wouldn't
come. I tried for a second or two to brace up and out with it,
but I warn't man enough&mdash;hadn't the spunk of a rabbit.  I
see I was weakening; so I just give up trying, and up and
says:</p>

<p>"He's white."</p>

<p>"I reckon we'll go and see for ourselves."</p>

<p>"I wish you would," says I, "because it's pap that's there,
and maybe you'd help me tow the raft ashore where the light is.
 He's sick&mdash;and so is mam and Mary Ann."</p>

<p>"Oh, the devil! we're in a hurry, boy.  But I s'pose we've got
to.  Come, buckle to your paddle, and let's get along."</p>

<p>I buckled to my paddle and they laid to their oars.  When we
had made a stroke or two, I says:</p>

<p>"Pap'll be mighty much obleeged to you, I can tell you.
 Everybody goes away when I want them to help me tow the raft
ashore, and I can't do it by myself."</p>

<p>"Well, that's infernal mean.  Odd, too.  Say, boy, what's the
matter with your father?"</p>

<p>"It's the&mdash;a&mdash;the&mdash;well, it ain't anything
much."</p>

<p>They stopped pulling.  It warn't but a mighty little ways to
the raft now. One says:</p>

<p>"Boy, that's a lie.  What IS the matter with your pap?  Answer
up square now, and it'll be the better for you."</p>

<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

<p>"I will, sir, I will, honest&mdash;but don't leave us, please.
 It's the&mdash;the&mdash;Gentlemen, if you'll only pull ahead,
and let me heave you the headline, you won't have to come a-near
the raft&mdash;please do."</p>

<p>"Set her back, John, set her back!" says one.  They backed
water.  "Keep away, boy&mdash;keep to looard.  Confound it, I
just expect the wind has blowed it to us.  Your pap's got the
small-pox, and you know it precious well.  Why didn't you come
out and say so?  Do you want to spread it all over?"</p>

<p>"Well," says I, a-blubbering, "I've told everybody before, and
they just went away and left us."</p>

<p>"Poor devil, there's something in that.  We are right down
sorry for you, but we&mdash;well, hang it, we don't want the
small-pox, you see.  Look here, I'll tell you what to do.  Don't
you try to land by yourself, or you'll smash everything to
pieces.  You float along down about twenty miles, and you'll come
to a town on the left-hand side of the river.  It will be long
after sun-up then, and when you ask for help you tell them your
folks are all down with chills and fever.  Don't be a fool again,
and let people guess what is the matter.  Now we're trying to do
you a kindness; so you just put twenty miles between us, that's a
good boy.  It wouldn't do any good to land yonder where the light
is&mdash;it's only a wood-yard. Say, I reckon your father's poor,
and I'm bound to say he's in pretty hard luck.  Here, I'll put a
twenty-dollar gold piece on this board, and you get it when it
floats by.  I feel mighty mean to leave you; but my kingdom! it
won't do to fool with small-pox, don't you see?"</p>

<p>"Hold on, Parker," says the other man, "here's a twenty to put
on the board for me.  Good-bye, boy; you do as Mr. Parker told
you, and you'll be all right."</p>

<p>"That's so, my boy&mdash;good-bye, good-bye.  If you see any
runaway niggers you get help and nab them, and you can make some
money by it."</p>

<p>"Good-bye, sir," says I; "I won't let no runaway niggers get
by me if I can help it."</p>

<p>They went off and I got aboard the raft, feeling bad and low,
because I knowed very well I had done wrong, and I see it warn't
no use for me to try to learn to do right; a body that don't get
STARTED right when he's little ain't got no show&mdash;when the
pinch comes there ain't nothing to back him up and keep him to
his work, and so he gets beat.  Then I thought a minute, and says
to myself, hold on; s'pose you'd a done right and give Jim up,
would you felt better than what you do now?  No, says I, I'd feel
bad&mdash;I'd feel just the same way I do now.  Well, then, says
I, what's the use you learning to do right when it's troublesome
to do right and ain't no trouble to do wrong, and the wages is
just the same?  I was stuck.  I couldn't answer that.  So I
reckoned I wouldn't bother no more about it, but after this
always do whichever come handiest at the time.</p>

<p>I went into the wigwam; Jim warn't there.  I looked all
around; he warn't anywhere.  I says:</p>

<p>"Jim!"</p>

<p>"Here I is, Huck.  Is dey out o' sight yit?  Don't talk
loud."</p>

<p>He was in the river under the stern oar, with just his nose
out.  I told him they were out of sight, so he come aboard.  He
says:</p>

<p>"I was a-listenin' to all de talk, en I slips into de river en
was gwyne to shove for sho' if dey come aboard.  Den I was gwyne
to swim to de raf' agin when dey was gone.  But lawsy, how you
did fool 'em, Huck!  Dat WUZ de smartes' dodge!  I tell you,
chile, I'spec it save' ole Jim&mdash;ole Jim ain't going to
forgit you for dat, honey."</p>

<p>Then we talked about the money.  It was a pretty good
raise&mdash;twenty dollars apiece.  Jim said we could take deck
passage on a steamboat now, and the money would last us as far as
we wanted to go in the free States. He said twenty mile more
warn't far for the raft to go, but he wished we was already
there.</p>

<p>Towards daybreak we tied up, and Jim was mighty particular
about hiding the raft good.  Then he worked all day fixing things
in bundles, and getting all ready to quit rafting.</p>

<p>That night about ten we hove in sight of the lights of a town
away down in a left-hand bend.</p>

<p>I went off in the canoe to ask about it.  Pretty soon I found
a man out in the river with a skiff, setting a trot-line.  I
ranged up and says:</p>

<p>"Mister, is that town Cairo?"</p>

<p>"Cairo? no.  You must be a blame' fool."</p>

<p>"What town is it, mister?"</p>

<p>"If you want to know, go and find out.  If you stay here
botherin' around me for about a half a minute longer you'll get
something you won't want."</p>

<p>I paddled to the raft.  Jim was awful disappointed, but I said
never mind, Cairo would be the next place, I reckoned.</p>

<p>We passed another town before daylight, and I was going out
again; but it was high ground, so I didn't go.  No high ground
about Cairo, Jim said. I had forgot it.  We laid up for the day
on a towhead tolerable close to the left-hand bank.  I begun to
suspicion something.  So did Jim.  I says:</p>

<p>"Maybe we went by Cairo in the fog that night."</p>

<p>He says:</p>

<p>"Doan' le's talk about it, Huck.  Po' niggers can't have no
luck.  I awluz 'spected dat rattlesnake-skin warn't done wid its
work."</p>

<p>"I wish I'd never seen that snake-skin, Jim&mdash;I do wish
I'd never laid eyes on it."</p>

<p>"It ain't yo' fault, Huck; you didn' know.  Don't you blame
yo'self 'bout it."</p>

<p>When it was daylight, here was the clear Ohio water inshore,
sure enough, and outside was the old regular Muddy!  So it was
all up with Cairo.</p>

<p>We talked it all over.  It wouldn't do to take to the shore;
we couldn't take the raft up the stream, of course.  There warn't
no way but to wait for dark, and start back in the canoe and take
the chances.  So we slept all day amongst the cottonwood thicket,
so as to be fresh for the work, and when we went back to the raft
about dark the canoe was gone!</p>

<p>We didn't say a word for a good while.  There warn't anything
to say.  We both knowed well enough it was some more work of the
rattlesnake-skin; so what was the use to talk about it?  It would
only look like we was finding fault, and that would be bound to
fetch more bad luck&mdash;and keep on fetching it, too, till we
knowed enough to keep still.</p>

<p>By and by we talked about what we better do, and found there
warn't no way but just to go along down with the raft till we got
a chance to buy a canoe to go back in.  We warn't going to borrow
it when there warn't anybody around, the way pap would do, for
that might set people after us.</p>

<p>So we shoved out after dark on the raft.</p>

<p>Anybody that don't believe yet that it's foolishness to handle
a snake-skin, after all that that snake-skin done for us, will
believe it now if they read on and see what more it done for
us.</p>

<p>The place to buy canoes is off of rafts laying up at shore.
 But we didn't see no rafts laying up; so we went along during
three hours and more.  Well, the night got gray and ruther thick,
which is the next meanest thing to fog.  You can't tell the shape
of the river, and you can't see no distance. It got to be very
late and still, and then along comes a steamboat up the river.
 We lit the lantern, and judged she would see it.  Up-stream
boats didn't generly come close to us; they go out and follow the
bars and hunt for easy water under the reefs; but nights like
this they bull right up the channel against the whole river.</p>

<p>We could hear her pounding along, but we didn't see her good
till she was close.  She aimed right for us.  Often they do that
and try to see how close they can come without touching;
sometimes the wheel bites off a sweep, and then the pilot sticks
his head out and laughs, and thinks he's mighty smart.  Well,
here she comes, and we said she was going to try and shave us;
but she didn't seem to be sheering off a bit.  She was a big one,
and she was coming in a hurry, too, looking like a black cloud
with rows of glow-worms around it; but all of a sudden she bulged
out, big and scary, with a long row of wide-open furnace doors
shining like red-hot teeth, and her monstrous bows and guards
hanging right over us.  There was a yell at us, and a jingling of
bells to stop the engines, a powwow of cussing, and whistling of
steam&mdash;and as Jim went overboard on one side and I on the
other, she come smashing straight through the raft.</p>

<p>I dived&mdash;and I aimed to find the bottom, too, for a
thirty-foot wheel had got to go over me, and I wanted it to have
plenty of room.  I could always stay under water a minute; this
time I reckon I stayed under a minute and a half.  Then I bounced
for the top in a hurry, for I was nearly busting.  I popped out
to my armpits and blowed the water out of my nose, and puffed a
bit.  Of course there was a booming current; and of course that
boat started her engines again ten seconds after she stopped
them, for they never cared much for raftsmen; so now she was
churning along up the river, out of sight in the thick weather,
though I could hear her.</p>

<p>I sung out for Jim about a dozen times, but I didn't get any
answer; so I grabbed a plank that touched me while I was
"treading water," and struck out for shore, shoving it ahead of
me.  But I made out to see that the drift of the current was
towards the left-hand shore, which meant that I was in a
crossing; so I changed off and went that way.</p>

<p>It was one of these long, slanting, two-mile crossings; so I
was a good long time in getting over.  I made a safe landing, and
clumb up the bank. I couldn't see but a little ways, but I went
poking along over rough ground for a quarter of a mile or more,
and then I run across a big old-fashioned double log-house
before I noticed it.  I was going to rush by and get away, but a
lot of dogs jumped out and went to howling and barking at me, and
I knowed better than to move another peg.</p>

CHAPTER XVII.</p>

<p>IN about a minute somebody spoke out of a window without
putting his head out, and says:</p>

<p>"Be done, boys!  Who's there?"</p>

<p>I says:</p>

<p>"It's me."</p>

<p>"Who's me?"</p>

<p>"George Jackson, sir."</p>

<p>"What do you want?"</p>

<p>"I don't want nothing, sir.  I only want to go along by, but
the dogs won't let me."</p>

<p>"What are you prowling around here this time of night
for&mdash;hey?"</p>

<p>"I warn't prowling around, sir, I fell overboard off of the
steamboat."</p>

<p>"Oh, you did, did you?  Strike a light there, somebody.  What
did you say your name was?"</p>

<p>"George Jackson, sir.  I'm only a boy."</p>

<p>"Look here, if you're telling the truth you needn't be
afraid&mdash;nobody'll hurt you.  But don't try to budge; stand
right where you are.  Rouse out Bob and Tom, some of you, and
fetch the guns.  George Jackson, is there anybody with you?"</p>

<p>"No, sir, nobody."</p>

<p>I heard the people stirring around in the house now, and see a
light. The man sung out:</p>

<p>"Snatch that light away, Betsy, you old fool&mdash;ain't you
got any sense? Put it on the floor behind the front door.  Bob,
if you and Tom are ready, take your places."</p>

<p>"All ready."</p>

<p>"Now, George Jackson, do you know the Shepherdsons?"</p>

<p>"No, sir; I never heard of them."</p>

<p>"Well, that may be so, and it mayn't.  Now, all ready.  Step
forward, George Jackson.  And mind, don't you hurry&mdash;come
mighty slow.  If there's anybody with you, let him keep
back&mdash;if he shows himself he'll be shot. Come along now.
 Come slow; push the door open yourself&mdash;just enough to
squeeze in, d' you hear?"</p>

<p>I didn't hurry; I couldn't if I'd a wanted to.  I took one
slow step at a time and there warn't a sound, only I thought I
could hear my heart.  The dogs were as still as the humans, but
they followed a little behind me. When I got to the three log
doorsteps I heard them unlocking and unbarring and unbolting.  I
put my hand on the door and pushed it a little and a little more
till somebody said, "There, that's enough&mdash;put your head
in." I done it, but I judged they would take it off.</p>

<p>The candle was on the floor, and there they all was, looking
at me, and me at them, for about a quarter of a minute:  Three
big men with guns pointed at me, which made me wince, I tell you;
the oldest, gray and about sixty, the other two thirty or
more&mdash;all of them fine and handsome&mdash;and the sweetest
old gray-headed lady, and back of her two young women which I
couldn't see right well.  The old gentleman says:</p>

<p>"There; I reckon it's all right.  Come in."</p>

<p>As soon as I was in the old gentleman he locked the door and
barred it and bolted it, and told the young men to come in with
their guns, and they all went in a big parlor that had a new rag
carpet on the floor, and got together in a corner that was out of
the range of the front windows&mdash;there warn't none on the
side.  They held the candle, and took a good look at me, and all
said, "Why, HE ain't a Shepherdson&mdash;no, there ain't any
Shepherdson about him."  Then the old man said he hoped I
wouldn't mind being searched for arms, because he didn't mean no
harm by it&mdash;it was only to make sure.  So he didn't pry into
my pockets, but only felt outside with his hands, and said it was
all right.  He told me to make myself easy and at home, and tell
all about myself; but the old lady says:</p>

<p>"Why, bless you, Saul, the poor thing's as wet as he can be;
and don't you reckon it may be he's hungry?"</p>

<p>"True for you, Rachel&mdash;I forgot."</p>

<p>So the old lady says:</p>

<p>"Betsy" (this was a nigger woman), "you fly around and get him
something to eat as quick as you can, poor thing; and one of you
girls go and wake up Buck and tell him&mdash;oh, here he is
himself.  Buck, take this little stranger and get the wet clothes
off from him and dress him up in some of yours that's dry."</p>

<p>Buck looked about as old as me&mdash;thirteen or fourteen or
along there, though he was a little bigger than me.  He hadn't on
anything but a shirt, and he was very frowzy-headed.  He came in
gaping and digging one fist into his eyes, and he was dragging a
gun along with the other one. He says:</p>

<br>
<br>
<a name="c17-134"></a>
<br>
<br>
<center>
<img alt="c17-134.jpg (51K)" src="images/c17-134.jpg" height="581" width="362">
</center>

<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

<p>"Ain't they no Shepherdsons around?"</p>

<p>They said, no, 'twas a false alarm.</p>

<p>"Well," he says, "if they'd a ben some, I reckon I'd a got
one."</p>

<p>They all laughed, and Bob says:</p>

<p>"Why, Buck, they might have scalped us all, you've been so
slow in coming."</p>

<p>"Well, nobody come after me, and it ain't right I'm always
kept down; I don't get no show."</p>

<p>"Never mind, Buck, my boy," says the old man, "you'll have
show enough, all in good time, don't you fret about that.  Go
'long with you now, and do as your mother told you."</p>

<p>When we got up-stairs to his room he got me a coarse shirt and
a roundabout and pants of his, and I put them on.  While I was at
it he asked me what my name was, but before I could tell him he
started to tell me about a bluejay and a young rabbit he had
catched in the woods day before yesterday, and he asked me where
Moses was when the candle went out.  I said I didn't know; I
hadn't heard about it before, no way.</p>

<p>"Well, guess," he says.</p>

<p>"How'm I going to guess," says I, "when I never heard tell of
it before?"</p>

<p>"But you can guess, can't you?  It's just as easy."</p>

<p>"WHICH candle?"  I says.</p>

<p>"Why, any candle," he says.</p>

<p>"I don't know where he was," says I; "where was he?"</p>

<p>"Why, he was in the DARK!  That's where he was!"</p>

<p>"Well, if you knowed where he was, what did you ask me
for?"</p>

<p>"Why, blame it, it's a riddle, don't you see?  Say, how long
are you going to stay here?  You got to stay always.  We can just
have booming times&mdash;they don't have no school now.  Do you
own a dog?  I've got a dog&mdash;and he'll go in the river and
bring out chips that you throw in.  Do you like to comb up
Sundays, and all that kind of foolishness?  You bet I don't, but
ma she makes me.  Confound these ole britches!  I reckon I'd
better put 'em on, but I'd ruther not, it's so warm.  Are you all
ready? All right.  Come along, old hoss."</p>

<p>Cold corn-pone, cold corn-beef, butter and
buttermilk&mdash;that is what they had for me down there, and
there ain't nothing better that ever I've come across yet.  Buck
and his ma and all of them smoked cob pipes, except the nigger
woman, which was gone, and the two young women.  They all smoked
and talked, and I eat and talked.  The young women had quilts
around them, and their hair down their backs.  They all asked me
questions, and I told them how pap and me and all the family was
living on a little farm down at the bottom of Arkansaw, and my
sister Mary Ann run off and got married and never was heard of no
more, and Bill went to hunt them and he warn't heard of no more,
and Tom and Mort died, and then there warn't nobody but just me
and pap left, and he was just trimmed down to nothing, on account
of his troubles; so when he died I took what there was left,
because the farm didn't belong to us, and started up the river,
deck passage, and fell overboard; and that was how I come to be
here.  So they said I could have a home there as long as I wanted
it.  Then it was most daylight and everybody went to bed, and I
went to bed with Buck, and when I waked up in the morning, drat
it all, I had forgot what my name was. So I laid there about an
hour trying to think, and when Buck waked up I says:</p>

<p>"Can you spell, Buck?"</p>

<p>"Yes," he says.</p>

<p>"I bet you can't spell my name," says I.</p>

<p>"I bet you what you dare I can," says he.</p>

<p>"All right," says I, "go ahead."</p>

<p>"G-e-o-r-g-e J-a-x-o-n&mdash;there now," he says.</p>

<p>"Well," says I, "you done it, but I didn't think you could.
 It ain't no slouch of a name to spell&mdash;right off without
studying."</p>

<p>I set it down, private, because somebody might want ME to
spell it next, and so I wanted to be handy with it and rattle it
off like I was used to it.</p>

<p>It was a mighty nice family, and a mighty nice house, too.  I
hadn't seen no house out in the country before that was so nice
and had so much style.  It didn't have an iron latch on the front
door, nor a wooden one with a buckskin string, but a brass knob
to turn, the same as houses in town. There warn't no bed in the
parlor, nor a sign of a bed; but heaps of parlors in towns has
beds in them.  There was a big fireplace that was bricked on the
bottom, and the bricks was kept clean and red by pouring water on
them and scrubbing them with another brick; sometimes they wash
them over with red water-paint that they call Spanish-brown, same
as they do in town.  They had big brass dog-irons that could hold
up a saw-log. There was a clock on the middle of the mantelpiece,
with a picture of a town painted on the bottom half of the glass
front, and a round place in the middle of it for the sun, and you
could see the pendulum swinging behind it.  It was beautiful to
hear that clock tick; and sometimes when one of these peddlers
had been along and scoured her up and got her in good shape, she
would start in and strike a hundred and fifty before she got
tuckered out.  They wouldn't took any money for her.</p>

<p>Well, there was a big outlandish parrot on each side of the
clock, made out of something like chalk, and painted up gaudy.
 By one of the parrots was a cat made of crockery, and a crockery
dog by the other; and when you pressed down on them they
squeaked, but didn't open their mouths nor look different nor
interested.  They squeaked through underneath.  There was a
couple of big wild-turkey-wing fans spread out behind those
things.  On the table in the middle of the room was a kind of a
lovely crockery basket that had apples and oranges and peaches
and grapes piled up in it, which was much redder and yellower and
prettier than real ones is, but they warn't real because you
could see where pieces had got chipped off and showed the white
chalk, or whatever it was, underneath.</p>

<p>This table had a cover made out of beautiful oilcloth, with a
red and blue spread-eagle painted on it, and a painted border all
around.  It come all the way from Philadelphia, they said.  There
was some books, too, piled up perfectly exact, on each corner of
the table.  One was a big family Bible full of pictures.  One was
Pilgrim's Progress, about a man that left his family, it didn't
say why.  I read considerable in it now and then.  The statements
was interesting, but tough.  Another was Friendship's Offering,
full of beautiful stuff and poetry; but I didn't read the poetry.
 Another was Henry Clay's Speeches, and another was Dr. Gunn's
Family Medicine, which told you all about what to do if a body
was sick or dead.  There was a hymn book, and a lot of other
books.  And there was nice split-bottom chairs, and perfectly
sound, too&mdash;not bagged down in the middle and busted, like
an old basket.</p>

<p>They had pictures hung on the walls&mdash;mainly Washingtons
and Lafayettes, and battles, and Highland Marys, and one called
"Signing the Declaration." There was some that they called
crayons, which one of the daughters which was dead made her own
self when she was only fifteen years old.  They was different
from any pictures I ever see before&mdash;blacker, mostly, than
is common.  One was a woman in a slim black dress, belted small
under the armpits, with bulges like a cabbage in the middle of
the sleeves, and a large black scoop-shovel bonnet with a black
veil, and white slim ankles crossed about with black tape, and
very wee black slippers, like a chisel, and she was leaning
pensive on a tombstone on her right elbow, under a weeping
willow, and her other hand hanging down her side holding a white
handkerchief and a reticule, and underneath the picture it said
"Shall I Never See Thee More Alas."  Another one was a young lady
with her hair all combed up straight to the top of her head, and
knotted there in front of a comb like a chair-back, and she was
crying into a handkerchief and had a dead bird laying on its back
in her other hand with its heels up, and underneath the picture
it said "I Shall Never Hear Thy Sweet Chirrup More Alas."  There
was one where a young lady was at a window looking up at the
moon, and tears running down her cheeks; and she had an open
letter in one hand with black sealing wax showing on one edge of
it, and she was mashing a locket with a chain to it against her
mouth, and underneath the picture it said "And Art Thou Gone Yes
Thou Art Gone Alas."  These was all nice pictures, I reckon, but
I didn't somehow seem to take to them, because if ever I was down
a little they always give me the fan-tods.  Everybody was sorry
she died, because she had laid out a lot more of these pictures
to do, and a body could see by what she had done what they had
lost.  But I reckoned that with her disposition she was having a
better time in the graveyard.  She was at work on what they said
was her greatest picture when she took sick, and every day and
every night it was her prayer to be allowed to live till she got
it done, but she never got the chance.  It was a picture of a
young woman in a long white gown, standing on the rail of a
bridge all ready to jump off, with her hair all down her back,
and looking up to the moon, with the tears running down her face,
and she had two arms folded across her breast, and two arms
stretched out in front, and two more reaching up towards the
moon&mdash;and the idea was to see which pair would look best,
and then scratch out all the other arms; but, as I was saying,
she died before she got her mind made up, and now they kept this
picture over the head of the bed in her room, and every time her
birthday come they hung flowers on it.  Other times it was hid
with a little curtain.  The young woman in the picture had a kind
of a nice sweet face, but there was so many arms it made her look
too spidery, seemed to me.</p>

<p>This young girl kept a scrap-book when she was alive, and used to paste
obituaries and accidents and cases of patient suffering in it out of the
Presbyterian Observer, and write poetry after them out of her own head.
It was very good poetry.  This is what she wrote about a boy by the name
of Stephen Dowling Bots that fell down a well and was drownded:</p>

<center><p>ODE TO STEPHEN DOWLING BOTS, DEC'D</p></center>

<div class="poem">
<p style="text-indent:0%;">And did young Stephen sicken,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;And did young Stephen die?<br>
And did the sad hearts thicken,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;And did the mourners cry?<br>
<br>
No; such was not the fate of<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;Young Stephen Dowling Bots;<br>
Though sad hearts round him thickened,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;'Twas not from sickness' shots.<br>
<br>
No whooping-cough did rack his frame,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;Nor measles drear with spots;<br>
Not these impaired the sacred name<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;Of Stephen Dowling Bots.<br>
<br>
Despised love struck not with woe<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;That head of curly knots,<br>
Nor stomach troubles laid him low,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;Young Stephen Dowling Bots.<br>
<br>
O no.  Then list with tearful eye,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;Whilst I his fate do tell.<br>
His soul did from this cold world fly<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;By falling down a well.<br>
<br>
They got him out and emptied him;<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;Alas it was too late;<br>
His spirit was gone for to sport aloft<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;In the realms of the good and great.<br></p></div>


<p>If Emmeline Grangerford could make poetry like that before she
was fourteen, there ain't no telling what she could a done by and
by.  Buck said she could rattle off poetry like nothing.  She
didn't ever have to stop to think.  He said she would slap down a
line, and if she couldn't find anything to rhyme with it would
just scratch it out and slap down another one, and go ahead. She
warn't particular; she could write about anything you choose to
give her to write about just so it was sadful. Every time a man
died, or a woman died, or a child died, she would be on hand with
her "tribute" before he was cold.  She called them tributes. The
neighbors said it was the doctor first, then Emmeline, then the
undertaker&mdash;the undertaker never got in ahead of Emmeline
but once, and then she hung fire on a rhyme for the dead person's
name, which was Whistler.  She warn't ever the same after that;
she never complained, but she kinder pined away and did not live
long.  Poor thing, many's the time I made myself go up to the
little room that used to be hers and get out her poor old
scrap-book and read in it when her pictures had been aggravating
me and I had soured on her a little.  I liked all that family,
dead ones and all, and warn't going to let anything come between
us.  Poor Emmeline made poetry about all the dead people when she
was alive, and it didn't seem right that there warn't nobody to
make some about her now she was gone; so I tried to sweat out a
verse or two myself, but I couldn't seem to make it go somehow.
 They kept Emmeline's room trim and nice, and all the things
fixed in it just the way she liked to have them when she was
alive, and nobody ever slept there.  The old lady took care of
the room herself, though there was plenty of niggers, and she
sewed there a good deal and read her Bible there mostly.</p>

<p>Well, as I was saying about the parlor, there was beautiful
curtains on the windows:  white, with pictures painted on them of
castles with vines all down the walls, and cattle coming down to
drink.  There was a little old piano, too, that had tin pans in
it, I reckon, and nothing was ever so lovely as to hear the young
ladies sing "The Last Link is Broken" and play "The Battle of
Prague" on it.  The walls of all the rooms was plastered, and
most had carpets on the floors, and the whole house was
whitewashed on the outside.</p>

<p>It was a double house, and the big open place betwixt them was
roofed and floored, and sometimes the table was set there in the
middle of the day, and it was a cool, comfortable place.  Nothing
couldn't be better.  And warn't the cooking good, and just
bushels of it too!</p>

CHAPTER XVIII.</p>

<p>COL.  GRANGERFORD was a gentleman, you see.  He was a
gentleman all over; and so was his family.  He was well born, as
the saying is, and that's worth as much in a man as it is in a
horse, so the Widow Douglas said, and nobody ever denied that she
was of the first aristocracy in our town; and pap he always said
it, too, though he warn't no more quality than a mudcat himself.
 Col.  Grangerford was very tall and very slim, and had a
darkish-paly complexion, not a sign of red in it anywheres; he
was clean shaved every morning all over his thin face, and he had
the thinnest kind of lips, and the thinnest kind of nostrils, and
a high nose, and heavy eyebrows, and the blackest kind of eyes,
sunk so deep back that they seemed like they was looking out of
caverns at you, as you may say.  His forehead was high, and his
hair was black and straight and hung to his shoulders. His hands
was long and thin, and every day of his life he put on a clean
shirt and a full suit from head to foot made out of linen so
white it hurt your eyes to look at it; and on Sundays he wore a
blue tail-coat with brass buttons on it.  He carried a mahogany
cane with a silver head to it.  There warn't no frivolishness
about him, not a bit, and he warn't ever loud.  He was as kind as
he could be&mdash;you could feel that, you know, and so you had
confidence.  Sometimes he smiled, and it was good to see; but
when he straightened himself up like a liberty-pole, and the
lightning begun to flicker out from under his eyebrows, you
wanted to climb a tree first, and find out what the matter was
afterwards.  He didn't ever have to tell anybody to mind their
manners&mdash;everybody was always good-mannered where he was.
 Everybody loved to have him around, too; he was sunshine most
always&mdash;I mean he made it seem like good weather.  When he
turned into a cloudbank it was awful dark for half a minute, and
that was enough; there wouldn't nothing go wrong again for a
week.</p>

<p>When him and the old lady come down in the morning all the
family got up out of their chairs and give them good-day, and
didn't set down again till they had set down.  Then Tom and Bob
went to the sideboard where the decanter was, and mixed a glass
of bitters and handed it to him, and he held it in his hand and
waited till Tom's and Bob's was mixed, and then they bowed and
said, "Our duty to you, sir, and madam;" and THEY bowed the least
bit in the world and said thank you, and so they drank, all
three, and Bob and Tom poured a spoonful of water on the sugar
and the mite of whisky or apple brandy in the bottom of their
tumblers, and give it to me and Buck, and we drank to the old
people too.</p>

<p>Bob was the oldest and Tom next&mdash;tall, beautiful men with
very broad shoulders and brown faces, and long black hair and
black eyes.  They dressed in white linen from head to foot, like
the old gentleman, and wore broad Panama hats.</p>

<p>Then there was Miss Charlotte; she was twenty-five, and tall
and proud and grand, but as good as she could be when she warn't
stirred up; but when she was she had a look that would make you
wilt in your tracks, like her father.  She was beautiful.</p>

<p>So was her sister, Miss Sophia, but it was a different kind.
 She was gentle and sweet like a dove, and she was only
twenty.</p>

<p>Each person had their own nigger to wait on them&mdash;Buck
too.  My nigger had a monstrous easy time, because I warn't used
to having anybody do anything for me, but Buck's was on the jump
most of the time.</p>

<p>This was all there was of the family now, but there used to be
more&mdash;three sons; they got killed; and Emmeline that
died.</p>

<p>The old gentleman owned a lot of farms and over a hundred
niggers. Sometimes a stack of people would come there, horseback,
from ten or fifteen mile around, and stay five or six days, and
have such junketings round about and on the river, and dances and
picnics in the woods daytimes, and balls at the house nights.
 These people was mostly kinfolks of the family.  The men brought
their guns with them.  It was a handsome lot of quality, I tell
you.</p>

<p>There was another clan of aristocracy around there&mdash;five
or six families&mdash;mostly of the name of Shepherdson.  They
was as high-toned and well born and rich and grand as the tribe
of Grangerfords.  The Shepherdsons and Grangerfords used the same
steamboat landing, which was about two mile above our house; so
sometimes when I went up there with a lot of our folks I used to
see a lot of the Shepherdsons there on their fine horses.</p>

<p>One day Buck and me was away out in the woods hunting, and
heard a horse coming.  We was crossing the road.  Buck says:</p>

<p>"Quick!  Jump for the woods!"</p>

<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

<p>We done it, and then peeped down the woods through the leaves.
 Pretty soon a splendid young man come galloping down the road,
setting his horse easy and looking like a soldier.  He had his
gun across his pommel.  I had seen him before.  It was young
Harney Shepherdson.  I heard Buck's gun go off at my ear, and
Harney's hat tumbled off from his head.  He grabbed his gun and
rode straight to the place where we was hid.  But we didn't wait.
 We started through the woods on a run.  The woods warn't thick,
so I looked over my shoulder to dodge the bullet, and twice I
seen Harney cover Buck with his gun; and then he rode away the
way he come&mdash;to get his hat, I reckon, but I couldn't see.
 We never stopped running till we got home.  The old gentleman's
eyes blazed a minute&mdash;'twas pleasure, mainly, I
judged&mdash;then his face sort of smoothed down, and he says,
kind of gentle:</p>

<p>"I don't like that shooting from behind a bush.  Why didn't
you step into the road, my boy?"</p>

<p>"The Shepherdsons don't, father.  They always take
advantage."</p>

<p>Miss Charlotte she held her head up like a queen while Buck
was telling his tale, and her nostrils spread and her eyes
snapped.  The two young men looked dark, but never said nothing.
 Miss Sophia she turned pale, but the color come back when she
found the man warn't hurt.</p>

<br>
<br>

<p>Soon as I could get Buck down by the corn-cribs under the
trees by ourselves, I says:</p>

<p>"Did you want to kill him, Buck?"</p>

<p>"Well, I bet I did."</p>

<p>"What did he do to you?"</p>

<p>"Him?  He never done nothing to me."</p>

<p>"Well, then, what did you want to kill him for?"</p>

<p>"Why, nothing&mdash;only it's on account of the feud."</p>

<p>"What's a feud?"</p>

<p>"Why, where was you raised?  Don't you know what a feud
is?"</p>

<p>"Never heard of it before&mdash;tell me about it."</p>

<p>"Well," says Buck, "a feud is this way:  A man has a quarrel
with another man, and kills him; then that other man's brother
kills HIM; then the other brothers, on both sides, goes for one
another; then the COUSINS chip in&mdash;and by and by everybody's
killed off, and there ain't no more feud.  But it's kind of slow,
and takes a long time."</p>

<p>"Has this one been going on long, Buck?"</p>

<p>"Well, I should RECKON!  It started thirty year ago, or
som'ers along there.  There was trouble 'bout something, and then
a lawsuit to settle it; and the suit went agin one of the men,
and so he up and shot the man that won the suit&mdash;which he
would naturally do, of course.  Anybody would."</p>

<p>"What was the trouble about, Buck?&mdash;land?"</p>

<p>"I reckon maybe&mdash;I don't know."</p>

<p>"Well, who done the shooting?  Was it a Grangerford or a
Shepherdson?"</p>

<p>"Laws, how do I know?  It was so long ago."</p>

<p>"Don't anybody know?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, pa knows, I reckon, and some of the other old
people; but they don't know now what the row was about in the
first place."</p>

<p>"Has there been many killed, Buck?"</p>

<p>"Yes; right smart chance of funerals.  But they don't always
kill.  Pa's got a few buckshot in him; but he don't mind it 'cuz
he don't weigh much, anyway.  Bob's been carved up some with a
bowie, and Tom's been hurt once or twice."</p>

<p>"Has anybody been killed this year, Buck?"</p>

<p>"Yes; we got one and they got one.  'Bout three months ago my
cousin Bud, fourteen year old, was riding through the woods on
t'other side of the river, and didn't have no weapon with him,
which was blame' foolishness, and in a lonesome place he hears a
horse a-coming behind him, and sees old Baldy Shepherdson
a-linkin' after him with his gun in his hand and his white hair
a-flying in the wind; and 'stead of jumping off and taking to the
brush, Bud 'lowed he could out-run him; so they had it, nip and
tuck, for five mile or more, the old man a-gaining all the time;
so at last Bud seen it warn't any use, so he stopped and faced
around so as to have the bullet holes in front, you know, and the
old man he rode up and shot him down.  But he didn't git much
chance to enjoy his luck, for inside of a week our folks laid HIM
out."</p>

<p>"I reckon that old man was a coward, Buck."</p>

<p>"I reckon he WARN'T a coward.  Not by a blame' sight.  There
ain't a coward amongst them Shepherdsons&mdash;not a one.  And
there ain't no cowards amongst the Grangerfords either.  Why,
that old man kep' up his end in a fight one day for half an hour
against three Grangerfords, and come out winner.  They was all
a-horseback; he lit off of his horse and got behind a little
woodpile, and kep' his horse before him to stop the bullets; but
the Grangerfords stayed on their horses and capered around the
old man, and peppered away at him, and he peppered away at them.
 Him and his horse both went home pretty leaky and crippled, but
the Grangerfords had to be FETCHED home&mdash;and one of 'em was
dead, and another died the next day.  No, sir; if a body's out
hunting for cowards he don't want to fool away any time amongst
them Shepherdsons, becuz they don't breed any of that KIND."</p>

<p>Next Sunday we all went to church, about three mile, everybody
a-horseback. The men took their guns along, so did Buck, and
kept them between their knees or stood them handy against the
wall.  The Shepherdsons done the same.  It was pretty ornery
preaching&mdash;all about brotherly love, and such-like
tiresomeness; but everybody said it was a good sermon, and they
all talked it over going home, and had such a powerful lot to say
about faith and good works and free grace and
preforeordestination, and I don't know what all, that it did seem
to me to be one of the roughest Sundays I had run across yet.</p>

<p>About an hour after dinner everybody was dozing around, some
in their chairs and some in their rooms, and it got to be pretty
dull.  Buck and a dog was stretched out on the grass in the sun
sound asleep.  I went up to our room, and judged I would take a
nap myself.  I found that sweet Miss Sophia standing in her door,
which was next to ours, and she took me in her room and shut the
door very soft, and asked me if I liked her, and I said I did;
and she asked me if I would do something for her and not tell
anybody, and I said I would.  Then she said she'd forgot her
Testament, and left it in the seat at church between two other
books, and would I slip out quiet and go there and fetch it to
her, and not say nothing to nobody.  I said I would. So I slid
out and slipped off up the road, and there warn't anybody at the
church, except maybe a hog or two, for there warn't any lock on
the door, and hogs likes a puncheon floor in summer-time because
it's cool.  If you notice, most folks don't go to church only
when they've got to; but a hog is different.</p>

<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

<p>Says I to myself, something's up; it ain't natural for a girl
to be in such a sweat about a Testament.  So I give it a shake,
and out drops a little piece of paper with "HALF-PAST TWO" wrote
on it with a pencil.  I ransacked it, but couldn't find anything
else.  I couldn't make anything out of that, so I put the paper
in the book again, and when I got home and upstairs there was
Miss Sophia in her door waiting for me.  She pulled me in and
shut the door; then she looked in the Testament till she found
the paper, and as soon as she read it she looked glad; and before
a body could think she grabbed me and give me a squeeze, and said
I was the best boy in the world, and not to tell anybody.  She
was mighty red in the face for a minute, and her eyes lighted up,
and it made her powerful pretty.  I was a good deal astonished,
but when I got my breath I asked her what the paper was about,
and she asked me if I had read it, and I said no, and she asked
me if I could read writing, and I told her "no, only
coarse-hand," and then she said the paper warn't anything but a
book-mark to keep her place, and I might go and play now.</p>

<p>I went off down to the river, studying over this thing, and
pretty soon I noticed that my nigger was following along behind.
 When we was out of sight of the house he looked back and around
a second, and then comes a-running, and says:</p>

<p>"Mars Jawge, if you'll come down into de swamp I'll show you a
whole stack o' water-moccasins."</p>

<p>Thinks I, that's mighty curious; he said that yesterday.  He
oughter know a body don't love water-moccasins enough to go
around hunting for them. What is he up to, anyway?  So I
says:</p>

<p>"All right; trot ahead."</p>

<p>I followed a half a mile; then he struck out over the swamp,
and waded ankle deep as much as another half-mile.  We come to a
little flat piece of land which was dry and very thick with trees
and bushes and vines, and he says:</p>

<p>"You shove right in dah jist a few steps, Mars Jawge; dah's
whah dey is. I's seed 'm befo'; I don't k'yer to see 'em no
mo'."</p>

<p>Then he slopped right along and went away, and pretty soon the
trees hid him.  I poked into the place a-ways and come to a
little open patch as big as a bedroom all hung around with vines,
and found a man laying there asleep&mdash;and, by jings, it was
my old Jim!</p>

<p>I waked him up, and I reckoned it was going to be a grand
surprise to him to see me again, but it warn't.  He nearly cried
he was so glad, but he warn't surprised.  Said he swum along
behind me that night, and heard me yell every time, but dasn't
answer, because he didn't want nobody to pick HIM up and take him
into slavery again.  Says he:</p>

<p>"I got hurt a little, en couldn't swim fas', so I wuz a
considable ways behine you towards de las'; when you landed I
reck'ned I could ketch up wid you on de lan' 'dout havin' to
shout at you, but when I see dat house I begin to go slow.  I 'uz
off too fur to hear what dey say to you&mdash;I wuz 'fraid o' de
dogs; but when it 'uz all quiet agin I knowed you's in de house,
so I struck out for de woods to wait for day.  Early in de
mawnin' some er de niggers come along, gwyne to de fields, en dey
tuk me en showed me dis place, whah de dogs can't track me on
accounts o' de water, en dey brings me truck to eat every night,
en tells me how you's a-gitt'n along."</p>

<p>"Why didn't you tell my Jack to fetch me here sooner,
Jim?"</p>

<p>"Well, 'twarn't no use to 'sturb you, Huck, tell we could do
sumfn&mdash;but we's all right now.  I ben a-buyin' pots en pans
en vittles, as I got a chanst, en a-patchin' up de raf' nights
when&mdash;"</p>

<p>"WHAT raft, Jim?"</p>

<p>"Our ole raf'."</p>

<p>"You mean to say our old raft warn't smashed all to
flinders?"</p>

<p>"No, she warn't.  She was tore up a good deal&mdash;one en' of
her was; but dey warn't no great harm done, on'y our traps was
mos' all los'.  Ef we hadn' dive' so deep en swum so fur under
water, en de night hadn' ben so dark, en we warn't so sk'yerd, en
ben sich punkin-heads, as de sayin' is, we'd a seed de raf'.  But
it's jis' as well we didn't, 'kase now she's all fixed up agin
mos' as good as new, en we's got a new lot o' stuff, in de place
o' what 'uz los'."</p>

<p>"Why, how did you get hold of the raft again, Jim&mdash;did
you catch her?"</p>

<p>"How I gwyne to ketch her en I out in de woods?  No; some er
de niggers foun' her ketched on a snag along heah in de ben', en
dey hid her in a crick 'mongst de willows, en dey wuz so much
jawin' 'bout which un 'um she b'long to de mos' dat I come to
heah 'bout it pooty soon, so I ups en settles de trouble by
tellin' 'um she don't b'long to none uv um, but to you en me; en
I ast 'm if dey gwyne to grab a young white genlman's propaty, en
git a hid'n for it?  Den I gin 'm ten cents apiece, en dey 'uz
mighty well satisfied, en wisht some mo' raf's 'ud come along en
make 'm rich agin. Dey's mighty good to me, dese niggers is, en
whatever I wants 'm to do fur me I doan' have to ast 'm twice,
honey.  Dat Jack's a good nigger, en pooty smart."</p>

<p>"Yes, he is.  He ain't ever told me you was here; told me to
come, and he'd show me a lot of water-moccasins.  If anything
happens HE ain't mixed up in it.  He can say he never seen us
together, and it 'll be the truth."</p>

<p>I don't want to talk much about the next day.  I reckon I'll
cut it pretty short.  I waked up about dawn, and was a-going to
turn over and go to sleep again when I noticed how still it
was&mdash;didn't seem to be anybody stirring.  That warn't usual.
 Next I noticed that Buck was up and gone. Well, I gets up,
a-wondering, and goes down stairs&mdash;nobody around; everything
as still as a mouse.  Just the same outside.  Thinks I, what does
it mean?  Down by the wood-pile I comes across my Jack, and
says:</p>

<p>"What's it all about?"</p>

<p>Says he:</p>

<p>"Don't you know, Mars Jawge?"</p>

<p>"No," says I, "I don't."</p>

<p>"Well, den, Miss Sophia's run off! 'deed she has.  She run off
in de night some time&mdash;nobody don't know jis' when; run off
to get married to dat young Harney Shepherdson, you
know&mdash;leastways, so dey 'spec.  De fambly foun' it out 'bout
half an hour ago&mdash;maybe a little mo'&mdash;en' I TELL you
dey warn't no time los'.  Sich another hurryin' up guns en hosses
YOU never see!  De women folks has gone for to stir up de
relations, en ole Mars Saul en de boys tuck dey guns en rode up
de river road for to try to ketch dat young man en kill him 'fo'
he kin git acrost de river wid Miss Sophia.  I reck'n dey's gwyne
to be mighty rough times."</p>

<p>"Buck went off 'thout waking me up."</p>

<p>"Well, I reck'n he DID!  Dey warn't gwyne to mix you up in it.
 Mars Buck he loaded up his gun en 'lowed he's gwyne to fetch
home a Shepherdson or bust. Well, dey'll be plenty un 'm dah, I
reck'n, en you bet you he'll fetch one ef he gits a chanst."</p>

<p>I took up the river road as hard as I could put.  By and by I
begin to hear guns a good ways off.  When I come in sight of the
log store and the woodpile where the steamboats lands I worked
along under the trees and brush till I got to a good place, and
then I clumb up into the forks of a cottonwood that was out of
reach, and watched.  There was a wood-rank four foot high a
little ways in front of the tree, and first I was going to hide
behind that; but maybe it was luckier I didn't.</p>

<p>There was four or five men cavorting around on their horses in
the open place before the log store, cussing and yelling, and
trying to get at a couple of young chaps that was behind the
wood-rank alongside of the steamboat landing; but they couldn't
come it.  Every time one of them showed himself on the river side
of the woodpile he got shot at.  The two boys was squatting back
to back behind the pile, so they could watch both ways.</p>

</center>

<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

<p>By and by the men stopped cavorting around and yelling.  They
started riding towards the store; then up gets one of the boys,
draws a steady bead over the wood-rank, and drops one of them out
of his saddle.  All the men jumped off of their horses and
grabbed the hurt one and started to carry him to the store; and
that minute the two boys started on the run.  They got half way
to the tree I was in before the men noticed. Then the men see
them, and jumped on their horses and took out after them.  They
gained on the boys, but it didn't do no good, the boys had too
good a start; they got to the woodpile that was in front of my
tree, and slipped in behind it, and so they had the bulge on the
men again. One of the boys was Buck, and the other was a slim
young chap about nineteen years old.</p>

<p>The men ripped around awhile, and then rode away.  As soon as
they was out of sight I sung out to Buck and told him.  He didn't
know what to make of my voice coming out of the tree at first.
 He was awful surprised.  He told me to watch out sharp and let
him know when the men come in sight again; said they was up to
some devilment or other&mdash;wouldn't be gone long.  I wished I
was out of that tree, but I dasn't come down.  Buck begun to cry
and rip, and 'lowed that him and his cousin Joe (that was the
other young chap) would make up for this day yet.  He said his
father and his two brothers was killed, and two or three of the
enemy.  Said the Shepherdsons laid for them in ambush.  Buck said
his father and brothers ought to waited for their
relations&mdash;the Shepherdsons was too strong for them.  I
asked him what was become of young Harney and Miss Sophia.  He
said they'd got across the river and was safe.  I was glad of
that; but the way Buck did take on because he didn't manage to
kill Harney that day he shot at him&mdash;I hain't ever heard
anything like it.</p>

<p>All of a sudden, bang! bang! bang! goes three or four
guns&mdash;the men had slipped around through the woods and come
in from behind without their horses!  The boys jumped for the
river&mdash;both of them hurt&mdash;and as they swum down the
current the men run along the bank shooting at them and singing
out, "Kill them, kill them!"  It made me so sick I most fell out
of the tree.  I ain't a-going to tell ALL that happened&mdash;it
would make me sick again if I was to do that.  I wished I hadn't
ever come ashore that night to see such things.  I ain't ever
going to get shut of them&mdash;lots of times I dream about
them.</p>

<p>I stayed in the tree till it begun to get dark, afraid to come
down. Sometimes I heard guns away off in the woods; and twice I
seen little gangs of men gallop past the log store with guns; so
I reckoned the trouble was still a-going on.  I was mighty
downhearted; so I made up my mind I wouldn't ever go anear that
house again, because I reckoned I was to blame, somehow. I judged
that that piece of paper meant that Miss Sophia was to meet
Harney somewheres at half-past two and run off; and I judged I
ought to told her father about that paper and the curious way she
acted, and then maybe he would a locked her up, and this awful
mess wouldn't ever happened.</p>

<p>When I got down out of the tree I crept along down the river
bank a piece, and found the two bodies laying in the edge of the
water, and tugged at them till I got them ashore; then I covered
up their faces, and got away as quick as I could.  I cried a
little when I was covering up Buck's face, for he was mighty good
to me.</p>

<p>It was just dark now.  I never went near the house, but struck
through the woods and made for the swamp.  Jim warn't on his
island, so I tramped off in a hurry for the crick, and crowded
through the willows, red-hot to jump aboard and get out of that
awful country.  The raft was gone!  My souls, but I was scared!
 I couldn't get my breath for most a minute. Then I raised a
yell.  A voice not twenty-five foot from me says:</p>

<p>"Good lan'! is dat you, honey?  Doan' make no noise."</p>

<p>It was Jim's voice&mdash;nothing ever sounded so good before.
 I run along the bank a piece and got aboard, and Jim he grabbed
me and hugged me, he was so glad to see me.  He says:</p>

<p>"Laws bless you, chile, I 'uz right down sho' you's dead agin.
 Jack's been heah; he say he reck'n you's ben shot, kase you
didn' come home no mo'; so I's jes' dis minute a startin' de raf'
down towards de mouf er de crick, so's to be all ready for to
shove out en leave soon as Jack comes agin en tells me for
certain you IS dead.  Lawsy, I's mighty glad to git you back
again, honey."</p>

<p>I says:</p>

<p>"All right&mdash;that's mighty good; they won't find me, and
they'll think I've been killed, and floated down the
river&mdash;there's something up there that 'll help them think
so&mdash;so don't you lose no time, Jim, but just shove off for
the big water as fast as ever you can."</p>

<p>I never felt easy till the raft was two mile below there and
out in the middle of the Mississippi.  Then we hung up our signal
lantern, and judged that we was free and safe once more.  I
hadn't had a bite to eat since yesterday, so Jim he got out some
corn-dodgers and buttermilk, and pork and cabbage and
greens&mdash;there ain't nothing in the world so good when it's
cooked right&mdash;and whilst I eat my supper we talked and had a
good time.  I was powerful glad to get away from the feuds, and
so was Jim to get away from the swamp.  We said there warn't no
home like a raft, after all.  Other places do seem so cramped up
and smothery, but a raft don't.  You feel mighty free and easy
and comfortable on a raft.</p>

CHAPTER XIX.</p>

<p>TWO or three days and nights went by; I reckon I might say
they swum by, they slid along so quiet and smooth and lovely.
 Here is the way we put in the time.  It was a monstrous big
river down there&mdash;sometimes a mile and a half wide; we run
nights, and laid up and hid daytimes; soon as night was most gone
we stopped navigating and tied up&mdash;nearly always in the dead
water under a towhead; and then cut young cottonwoods and
willows, and hid the raft with them.  Then we set out the lines.
 Next we slid into the river and had a swim, so as to freshen up
and cool off; then we set down on the sandy bottom where the
water was about knee deep, and watched the daylight come.  Not a
sound anywheres&mdash;perfectly still&mdash;just like the whole
world was asleep, only sometimes the bullfrogs a-cluttering,
maybe.  The first thing to see, looking away over the water, was
a kind of dull line&mdash;that was the woods on t'other side; you
couldn't make nothing else out; then a pale place in the sky;
then more paleness spreading around; then the river softened up
away off, and warn't black any more, but gray; you could see
little dark spots drifting along ever so far away&mdash;trading
scows, and such things; and long black streaks&mdash;rafts;
sometimes you could hear a sweep screaking; or jumbled up voices,
it was so still, and sounds come so far; and by and by you could
see a streak on the water which you know by the look of the
streak that there's a snag there in a swift current which breaks
on it and makes that streak look that way; and you see the mist
curl up off of the water, and the east reddens up, and the river,
and you make out a log-cabin in the edge of the woods, away on
the bank on t'other side of the river, being a woodyard, likely,
and piled by them cheats so you can throw a dog through it
anywheres; then the nice breeze springs up, and comes fanning you
from over there, so cool and fresh and sweet to smell on account
of the woods and the flowers; but sometimes not that way, because
they've left dead fish laying around, gars and such, and they do
get pretty rank; and next you've got the full day, and everything
smiling in the sun, and the song-birds just going it!</p>

<p>A little smoke couldn't be noticed now, so we would take some
fish off of the lines and cook up a hot breakfast.  And
afterwards we would watch the lonesomeness of the river, and kind
of lazy along, and by and by lazy off to sleep.  Wake up by and
by, and look to see what done it, and maybe see a steamboat
coughing along up-stream, so far off towards the other side you
couldn't tell nothing about her only whether she was a
stern-wheel or side-wheel; then for about an hour there wouldn't
be nothing to hear nor nothing to see&mdash;just solid
lonesomeness.  Next you'd see a raft sliding by, away off yonder,
and maybe a galoot on it chopping, because they're most always
doing it on a raft; you'd see the axe flash and come
down&mdash; you don't hear nothing; you see that axe go up again, and by the
time it's above the man's head then you hear the
K'CHUNK!&mdash;it had took all that time to come over the water.
 So we would put in the day, lazying around, listening to the
stillness.  Once there was a thick fog, and the rafts and things
that went by was beating tin pans so the steamboats wouldn't run
over them.  A scow or a raft went by so close we could hear them
talking and cussing and laughing&mdash;heard them plain; but we
couldn't see no sign of them; it made you feel crawly; it was
like spirits carrying on that way in the air.  Jim said he
believed it was spirits; but I says:</p>

<p>"No; spirits wouldn't say, 'Dern the dern fog.'"</p>

<p>Soon as it was night out we shoved; when we got her out to
about the middle we let her alone, and let her float wherever the
current wanted her to; then we lit the pipes, and dangled our
legs in the water, and talked about all kinds of things&mdash;we
was always naked, day and night, whenever the mosquitoes would
let us&mdash;the new clothes Buck's folks made for me was too
good to be comfortable, and besides I didn't go much on clothes,
nohow.</p>

<p>Sometimes we'd have that whole river all to ourselves for the
longest time. Yonder was the banks and the islands, across the
water; and maybe a spark&mdash;which was a candle in a cabin
window; and sometimes on the water you could see a spark or
two&mdash;on a raft or a scow, you know; and maybe you could hear
a fiddle or a song coming over from one of them crafts. It's
lovely to live on a raft.  We had the sky up there, all speckled
with stars, and we used to lay on our backs and look up at them,
and discuss about whether they was made or only just happened.
 Jim he allowed they was made, but I allowed they happened; I
judged it would have took too long to MAKE so many.  Jim said the
moon could a LAID them; well, that looked kind of reasonable, so
I didn't say nothing against it, because I've seen a frog lay
most as many, so of course it could be done. We used to watch the
stars that fell, too, and see them streak down.  Jim allowed
they'd got spoiled and was hove out of the nest.</p>

<p>Once or twice of a night we would see a steamboat slipping
along in the dark, and now and then she would belch a whole world
of sparks up out of her chimbleys, and they would rain down in
the river and look awful pretty; then she would turn a corner and
her lights would wink out and her powwow shut off and leave the
river still again; and by and by her waves would get to us, a
long time after she was gone, and joggle the raft a bit, and
after that you wouldn't hear nothing for you couldn't tell how
long, except maybe frogs or something.</p>

<p>After midnight the people on shore went to bed, and then for
two or three hours the shores was black&mdash;no more sparks in
the cabin windows.  These sparks was our clock&mdash;the first
one that showed again meant morning was coming, so we hunted a
place to hide and tie up right away.</p>

<p>One morning about daybreak I found a canoe and crossed over a
chute to the main shore&mdash;it was only two hundred
yards&mdash;and paddled about a mile up a crick amongst the
cypress woods, to see if I couldn't get some berries. Just as I
was passing a place where a kind of a cowpath crossed the crick,
here comes a couple of men tearing up the path as tight as they
could foot it.  I thought I was a goner, for whenever anybody was
after anybody I judged it was ME&mdash;or maybe Jim.  I was about
to dig out from there in a hurry, but they was pretty close to me
then, and sung out and begged me to save their lives&mdash;said
they hadn't been doing nothing, and was being chased for
it&mdash;said there was men and dogs a-coming.  They wanted to
jump right in, but I says:</p>

<br>
<br>
<br>

<a name="c19-160"></a>
<br>

<img alt="c19-160.jpg (84K)" src="images/c19-160.jpg" height="589" width="474">
</center>

<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

<p>"Don't you do it.  I don't hear the dogs and horses yet;
you've got time to crowd through the brush and get up the crick a
little ways; then you take to the water and wade down to me and
get in&mdash;that'll throw the dogs off the scent."</p>

<p>They done it, and soon as they was aboard I lit out for our
towhead, and in about five or ten minutes we heard the dogs and
the men away off, shouting. We heard them come along towards the
crick, but couldn't see them; they seemed to stop and fool around
a while; then, as we got further and further away all the time,
we couldn't hardly hear them at all; by the time we had left a
mile of woods behind us and struck the river, everything was
quiet, and we paddled over to the towhead and hid in the
cottonwoods and was safe.</p>

<p>One of these fellows was about seventy or upwards, and had a
bald head and very gray whiskers.  He had an old battered-up
slouch hat on, and a greasy blue woollen shirt, and ragged old
blue jeans britches stuffed into his boot-tops, and home-knit
galluses&mdash;no, he only had one.  He had an old long-tailed
blue jeans coat with slick brass buttons flung over his arm, and
both of them had big, fat, ratty-looking carpet-bags.</p>

<p>The other fellow was about thirty, and dressed about as
ornery.  After breakfast we all laid off and talked, and the
first thing that come out was that these chaps didn't know one
another.</p>

<p>"What got you into trouble?" says the baldhead to t'other
chap.</p>

<p>"Well, I'd been selling an article to take the tartar off the
teeth&mdash;and it does take it off, too, and generly the enamel
along with it&mdash;but I stayed about one night longer than I
ought to, and was just in the act of sliding out when I ran
across you on the trail this side of town, and you told me they
were coming, and begged me to help you to get off.  So I told you
I was expecting trouble myself, and would scatter out WITH you.
That's the whole yarn&mdash;what's yourn?</p>

<p>"Well, I'd ben a-running' a little temperance revival thar
'bout a week, and was the pet of the women folks, big and little,
for I was makin' it mighty warm for the rummies, I TELL you, and
takin' as much as five or six dollars a night&mdash;ten cents a
head, children and niggers free&mdash;and business a-growin' all
the time, when somehow or another a little report got around last
night that I had a way of puttin' in my time with a private jug
on the sly.  A nigger rousted me out this mornin', and told me
the people was getherin' on the quiet with their dogs and horses,
and they'd be along pretty soon and give me 'bout half an hour's
start, and then run me down if they could; and if they got me
they'd tar and feather me and ride me on a rail, sure.  I didn't
wait for no breakfast&mdash;I warn't hungry."</p>

<p>"Old man," said the young one, "I reckon we might double-team
it together; what do you think?"</p>

<p>"I ain't undisposed.  What's your line&mdash;mainly?"</p>

<p>"Jour printer by trade; do a little in patent medicines;
theater-actor&mdash;tragedy, you know; take a turn to mesmerism
and phrenology when there's a chance; teach singing-geography
school for a change; sling a lecture sometimes&mdash;oh, I do
lots of things&mdash;most anything that comes handy, so it ain't
work.  What's your lay?"</p>

<p>"I've done considerble in the doctoring way in my time.
 Layin' on o' hands is my best holt&mdash;for cancer and
paralysis, and sich things; and I k'n tell a fortune pretty good
when I've got somebody along to find out the facts for me.
 Preachin's my line, too, and workin' camp-meetin's, and
missionaryin' around."</p>

<p>Nobody never said anything for a while; then the young man
hove a sigh and says:</p>

<p>"Alas!"</p>

<p>"What 're you alassin' about?" says the bald-head.</p>

<p>"To think I should have lived to be leading such a life, and
be degraded down into such company."  And he begun to wipe the
corner of his eye with a rag.</p>

<p>"Dern your skin, ain't the company good enough for you?" says
the baldhead, pretty pert and uppish.</p>

<p>"Yes, it IS good enough for me; it's as good as I deserve; for
who fetched me so low when I was so high?  I did myself.  I don't
blame YOU, gentlemen&mdash;far from it; I don't blame anybody.  I
deserve it all.  Let the cold world do its worst; one thing I
know&mdash;there's a grave somewhere for me. The world may go on
just as it's always done, and take everything from me&mdash;loved
ones, property, everything; but it can't take that. Some day I'll
lie down in it and forget it all, and my poor broken heart will
be at rest."  He went on a-wiping.</p>

<p>"Drot your pore broken heart," says the baldhead; "what are
you heaving your pore broken heart at US f'r?  WE hain't done
nothing."</p>

<p>"No, I know you haven't.  I ain't blaming you, gentlemen.  I
brought myself down&mdash;yes, I did it myself.  It's right I
should suffer&mdash;perfectly right&mdash;I don't make any
moan."</p>

<p>"Brought you down from whar?  Whar was you brought down
from?"</p>

<p>"Ah, you would not believe me; the world never
believes&mdash;let it pass&mdash;'tis no matter.  The secret of
my birth&mdash;"</p>

<p>"The secret of your birth!  Do you mean to say&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Gentlemen," says the young man, very solemn, "I will reveal
it to you, for I feel I may have confidence in you.  By rights I
am a duke!"</p>

<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<a name="c19-163"></a>

<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>


<p>Jim's eyes bugged out when he heard that; and I reckon mine
did, too. Then the baldhead says:  "No! you can't mean it?"</p>

<p>"Yes.  My great-grandfather, eldest son of the Duke of
Bridgewater, fled to this country about the end of the last
century, to breathe the pure air of freedom; married here, and
died, leaving a son, his own father dying about the same time.
 The second son of the late duke seized the titles and
estates&mdash;the infant real duke was ignored.  I am the lineal
descendant of that infant&mdash;I am the rightful Duke of
Bridgewater; and here am I, forlorn, torn from my high estate,
hunted of men, despised by the cold world, ragged, worn,
heart-broken, and degraded to the companionship of felons on a
raft!"</p>

<p>Jim pitied him ever so much, and so did I. We tried to comfort
him, but he said it warn't much use, he couldn't be much
comforted; said if we was a mind to acknowledge him, that would
do him more good than most anything else; so we said we would, if
he would tell us how.  He said we ought to bow when we spoke to
him, and say "Your Grace," or "My Lord," or "Your
Lordship"&mdash;and he wouldn't mind it if we called him plain
"Bridgewater," which, he said, was a title anyway, and not a
name; and one of us ought to wait on him at dinner, and do any
little thing for him he wanted done.</p>

<p>Well, that was all easy, so we done it.  All through dinner
Jim stood around and waited on him, and says, "Will yo' Grace
have some o' dis or some o' dat?" and so on, and a body could see
it was mighty pleasing to him.</p>

<p>But the old man got pretty silent by and by&mdash;didn't have
much to say, and didn't look pretty comfortable over all that
petting that was going on around that duke.  He seemed to have
something on his mind.  So, along in the afternoon, he says:</p>

<p>"Looky here, Bilgewater," he says, "I'm nation sorry for you,
but you ain't the only person that's had troubles like that."</p>

<p>"No?"</p>

<p>"No you ain't.  You ain't the only person that's ben snaked
down wrongfully out'n a high place."</p>

<p>"Alas!"</p>

<p>"No, you ain't the only person that's had a secret of his
birth."  And, by jings, HE begins to cry.</p>

<p>"Hold!  What do you mean?"</p>

<p>"Bilgewater, kin I trust you?" says the old man, still sort of
sobbing.</p>

<p>"To the bitter death!"  He took the old man by the hand and
squeezed it, and says, "That secret of your being:  speak!"</p>

<p>"Bilgewater, I am the late Dauphin!"</p>

<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<a name="c19-165"></a>

</center>

<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>


<p>You bet you, Jim and me stared this time.  Then the duke
says:</p>

<p>"You are what?"</p>

<p>"Yes, my friend, it is too true&mdash;your eyes is lookin' at
this very moment on the pore disappeared Dauphin, Looy the
Seventeen, son of Looy the Sixteen and Marry Antonette."</p>

<p>"You!  At your age!  No!  You mean you're the late
Charlemagne; you must be six or seven hundred years old, at the
very least."</p>

<p>"Trouble has done it, Bilgewater, trouble has done it; trouble
has brung these gray hairs and this premature balditude.  Yes,
gentlemen, you see before you, in blue jeans and misery, the
wanderin', exiled, trampled-on, and sufferin' rightful King of
France."</p>

<p>Well, he cried and took on so that me and Jim didn't know
hardly what to do, we was so sorry&mdash;and so glad and proud
we'd got him with us, too.  So we set in, like we done before
with the duke, and tried to comfort HIM. But he said it warn't no
use, nothing but to be dead and done with it all could do him any
good; though he said it often made him feel easier and better for
a while if people treated him according to his rights, and got
down on one knee to speak to him, and always called him "Your
Majesty," and waited on him first at meals, and didn't set down
in his presence till he asked them. So Jim and me set to
majestying him, and doing this and that and t'other for him, and
standing up till he told us we might set down.  This done him
heaps of good, and so he got cheerful and comfortable.  But the
duke kind of soured on him, and didn't look a bit satisfied with
the way things was going; still, the king acted real friendly
towards him, and said the duke's great-grandfather and all the
other Dukes of Bilgewater was a good deal thought of by HIS
father, and was allowed to come to the palace considerable; but
the duke stayed huffy a good while, till by and by the king
says:</p>

<p>"Like as not we got to be together a blamed long time on this
h-yer raft, Bilgewater, and so what's the use o' your bein' sour?
 It 'll only make things oncomfortable.  It ain't my fault I
warn't born a duke, it ain't your fault you warn't born a
king&mdash;so what's the use to worry?  Make the best o' things
the way you find 'em, says I&mdash;that's my motto.  This ain't
no bad thing that we've struck here&mdash;plenty grub and an easy
life&mdash;come, give us your hand, duke, and le's all be
friends."</p>

<p>The duke done it, and Jim and me was pretty glad to see it.
 It took away all the uncomfortableness and we felt mighty good
over it, because it would a been a miserable business to have any
unfriendliness on the raft; for what you want, above all things,
on a raft, is for everybody to be satisfied, and feel right and
kind towards the others.</p>

<p>It didn't take me long to make up my mind that these liars
warn't no kings nor dukes at all, but just low-down humbugs and
frauds.  But I never said nothing, never let on; kept it to
myself; it's the best way; then you don't have no quarrels, and
don't get into no trouble.  If they wanted us to call them kings
and dukes, I hadn't no objections, 'long as it would keep peace
in the family; and it warn't no use to tell Jim, so I didn't tell
him.  If I never learnt nothing else out of pap, I learnt that
the best way to get along with his kind of people is to let them
have their own way.</p>

CHAPTER XX.</p>

<p>THEY asked us considerable many questions; wanted to know what
we covered up the raft that way for, and laid by in the daytime
instead of running&mdash;was Jim a runaway nigger?  Says I:</p>

<p>"Goodness sakes! would a runaway nigger run SOUTH?"</p>

<p>No, they allowed he wouldn't.  I had to account for things
some way, so I says:</p>

<p>"My folks was living in Pike County, in Missouri, where I was
born, and they all died off but me and pa and my brother Ike.
 Pa, he 'lowed he'd break up and go down and live with Uncle Ben,
who's got a little one-horse place on the river, forty-four mile
below Orleans.  Pa was pretty poor, and had some debts; so when
he'd squared up there warn't nothing left but sixteen dollars and
our nigger, Jim.  That warn't enough to take us fourteen hundred
mile, deck passage nor no other way.  Well, when the river rose
pa had a streak of luck one day; he ketched this piece of a raft;
so we reckoned we'd go down to Orleans on it.  Pa's luck didn't
hold out; a steamboat run over the forrard corner of the raft one
night, and we all went overboard and dove under the wheel; Jim
and me come up all right, but pa was drunk, and Ike was only four
years old, so they never come up no more.  Well, for the next day
or two we had considerable trouble, because people was always
coming out in skiffs and trying to take Jim away from me, saying
they believed he was a runaway nigger.  We don't run daytimes no
more now; nights they don't bother us."</p>

<p>The duke says:</p>

<p>"Leave me alone to cipher out a way so we can run in the
daytime if we want to.  I'll think the thing over&mdash;I'll
invent a plan that'll fix it. We'll let it alone for to-day,
because of course we don't want to go by that town yonder in
daylight&mdash;it mightn't be healthy."</p>

<p>Towards night it begun to darken up and look like rain; the
heat lightning was squirting around low down in the sky, and the
leaves was beginning to shiver&mdash;it was going to be pretty
ugly, it was easy to see that.  So the duke and the king went to
overhauling our wigwam, to see what the beds was like.  My bed
was a straw tick better than Jim's, which was a corn-shuck tick;
there's always cobs around about in a shuck tick, and they poke
into you and hurt; and when you roll over the dry shucks sound
like you was rolling over in a pile of dead leaves; it makes such
a rustling that you wake up.  Well, the duke allowed he would
take my bed; but the king allowed he wouldn't.  He says:</p>

<p>"I should a reckoned the difference in rank would a sejested
to you that a corn-shuck bed warn't just fitten for me to sleep
on.  Your Grace 'll take the shuck bed yourself."</p>

<p>Jim and me was in a sweat again for a minute, being afraid
there was going to be some more trouble amongst them; so we was
pretty glad when the duke says:</p>

<p>"'Tis my fate to be always ground into the mire under the iron
heel of oppression.  Misfortune has broken my once haughty
spirit; I yield, I submit; 'tis my fate.  I am alone in the
world&mdash;let me suffer; can bear it."</p>

<p>We got away as soon as it was good and dark.  The king told us
to stand well out towards the middle of the river, and not show a
light till we got a long ways below the town.  We come in sight
of the little bunch of lights by and by&mdash;that was the town,
you know&mdash;and slid by, about a half a mile out, all right.
 When we was three-quarters of a mile below we hoisted up our
signal lantern; and about ten o'clock it come on to rain and blow
and thunder and lighten like everything; so the king told us to
both stay on watch till the weather got better; then him and the
duke crawled into the wigwam and turned in for the night.  It was
my watch below till twelve, but I wouldn't a turned in anyway if
I'd had a bed, because a body don't see such a storm as that
every day in the week, not by a long sight.  My souls, how the
wind did scream along!  And every second or two there'd come a
glare that lit up the white-caps for a half a mile around, and
you'd see the islands looking dusty through the rain, and the
trees thrashing around in the wind; then comes a
H-WHACK!&mdash;bum! bum!
bumble-umble-um-bum-bum-bum-bum&mdash;and the thunder would go
rumbling and grumbling away, and quit&mdash;and then RIP comes
another flash and another sockdolager.  The waves most washed me
off the raft sometimes, but I hadn't any clothes on, and didn't
mind.  We didn't have no trouble about snags; the lightning was
glaring and flittering around so constant that we could see them
plenty soon enough to throw her head this way or that and miss
them.</p>

<p>I had the middle watch, you know, but I was pretty sleepy by
that time, so Jim he said he would stand the first half of it for
me; he was always mighty good that way, Jim was.  I crawled into
the wigwam, but the king and the duke had their legs sprawled
around so there warn't no show for me; so I laid outside&mdash;I
didn't mind the rain, because it was warm, and the waves warn't
running so high now.  About two they come up again, though, and
Jim was going to call me; but he changed his mind, because he
reckoned they warn't high enough yet to do any harm; but he was
mistaken about that, for pretty soon all of a sudden along comes
a regular ripper and washed me overboard.  It most killed Jim
a-laughing.  He was the easiest nigger to laugh that ever was,
anyway.</p>

<p>I took the watch, and Jim he laid down and snored away; and by
and by the storm let up for good and all; and the first
cabin-light that showed I rousted him out, and we slid the raft
into hiding quarters for the day.</p>

<p>The king got out an old ratty deck of cards after breakfast,
and him and the duke played seven-up a while, five cents a game.
 Then they got tired of it, and allowed they would "lay out a
campaign," as they called it. The duke went down into his
carpet-bag, and fetched up a lot of little printed bills and read
them out loud.  One bill said, "The celebrated Dr. Armand de
Montalban, of Paris," would "lecture on the Science of
Phrenology" at such and such a place, on the blank day of blank,
at ten cents admission, and "furnish charts of character at
twenty-five cents apiece."  The duke said that was HIM.  In
another bill he was the "world-renowned Shakespearian tragedian,
Garrick the Younger, of Drury Lane, London."  In other bills he
had a lot of other names and done other wonderful things, like
finding water and gold with a "divining-rod," "dissipating witch
spells," and so on.  By and by he says:</p>

<p>"But the histrionic muse is the darling.  Have you ever trod
the boards, Royalty?"</p>

<p>"No," says the king.</p>

<p>"You shall, then, before you're three days older, Fallen
Grandeur," says the duke.  "The first good town we come to we'll
hire a hall and do the sword fight in Richard III. and the
balcony scene in Romeo and Juliet. How does that strike you?"</p>

<p>"I'm in, up to the hub, for anything that will pay,
Bilgewater; but, you see, I don't know nothing about play-actin',
and hain't ever seen much of it.  I was too small when pap used
to have 'em at the palace.  Do you reckon you can learn me?"</p>

<p>"Easy!"</p>

<p>"All right.  I'm jist a-freezn' for something fresh, anyway.
 Le's commence right away."</p>

<p>So the duke he told him all about who Romeo was and who Juliet
was, and said he was used to being Romeo, so the king could be
Juliet.</p>

<p>"But if Juliet's such a young gal, duke, my peeled head and my
white whiskers is goin' to look oncommon odd on her, maybe."</p>

<p>"No, don't you worry; these country jakes won't ever think of
that. Besides, you know, you'll be in costume, and that makes all
the difference in the world; Juliet's in a balcony, enjoying the
moonlight before she goes to bed, and she's got on her night-gown
and her ruffled nightcap.  Here are the costumes for the
parts."</p>

<p>He got out two or three curtain-calico suits, which he said
was meedyevil armor for Richard III. and t'other chap, and a long
white cotton nightshirt and a ruffled nightcap to match.  The
king was satisfied; so the duke got out his book and read the
parts over in the most splendid spread-eagle way, prancing around
and acting at the same time, to show how it had got to be done;
then he give the book to the king and told him to get his part by
heart.</p>

<p>There was a little one-horse town about three mile down the
bend, and after dinner the duke said he had ciphered out his idea
about how to run in daylight without it being dangersome for Jim;
so he allowed he would go down to the town and fix that thing.
 The king allowed he would go, too, and see if he couldn't strike
something.  We was out of coffee, so Jim said I better go along
with them in the canoe and get some.</p>

<p>When we got there there warn't nobody stirring; streets empty,
and perfectly dead and still, like Sunday.  We found a sick
nigger sunning himself in a back yard, and he said everybody that
warn't too young or too sick or too old was gone to camp-meeting,
about two mile back in the woods.  The king got the directions,
and allowed he'd go and work that camp-meeting for all it was
worth, and I might go, too.</p>

<p>The duke said what he was after was a printing-office.  We
found it; a little bit of a concern, up over a carpenter
shop&mdash;carpenters and printers all gone to the meeting, and
no doors locked.  It was a dirty, littered-up place, and had ink
marks, and handbills with pictures of horses and runaway niggers
on them, all over the walls.  The duke shed his coat and said he
was all right now.  So me and the king lit out for the
camp-meeting.</p>

<p>We got there in about a half an hour fairly dripping, for it
was a most awful hot day.  There was as much as a thousand people
there from twenty mile around.  The woods was full of teams and
wagons, hitched everywheres, feeding out of the wagon-troughs and
stomping to keep off the flies.  There was sheds made out of
poles and roofed over with branches, where they had lemonade and
gingerbread to sell, and piles of watermelons and green corn and
such-like truck.</p>

<p>The preaching was going on under the same kinds of sheds, only
they was bigger and held crowds of people.  The benches was made
out of outside slabs of logs, with holes bored in the round side
to drive sticks into for legs. They didn't have no backs.  The
preachers had high platforms to stand on at one end of the sheds.
 The women had on sun-bonnets; and some had linsey-woolsey
frocks, some gingham ones, and a few of the young ones had on
calico.  Some of the young men was barefooted, and some of the
children didn't have on any clothes but just a tow-linen shirt.
 Some of the old women was knitting, and some of the young folks
was courting on the sly.</p>

<br>


<p>The first shed we come to the preacher was lining out a hymn.
 He lined out two lines, everybody sung it, and it was kind of
grand to hear it, there was so many of them and they done it in
such a rousing way; then he lined out two more for them to
sing&mdash;and so on.  The people woke up more and more, and sung
louder and louder; and towards the end some begun to groan, and
some begun to shout.  Then the preacher begun to preach, and
begun in earnest, too; and went weaving first to one side of the
platform and then the other, and then a-leaning down over the
front of it, with his arms and his body going all the time, and
shouting his words out with all his might; and every now and then
he would hold up his Bible and spread it open, and kind of pass
it around this way and that, shouting, "It's the brazen serpent
in the wilderness!  Look upon it and live!"  And people would
shout out, "Glory!&mdash;A-a-MEN!"  And so he went on, and the
people groaning and crying and saying amen:</p>

<p>"Oh, come to the mourners' bench! come, black with sin!
(AMEN!) come, sick and sore! (AMEN!) come, lame and halt and
blind! (AMEN!) come, pore and needy, sunk in shame! (A-A-MEN!)
come, all that's worn and soiled and suffering!&mdash;come with a
broken spirit! come with a contrite heart! come in your rags and
sin and dirt! the waters that cleanse is free, the door of heaven
stands open&mdash;oh, enter in and be at rest!" (A-A-MEN!  GLORY,
GLORY HALLELUJAH!)</p>

<p>And so on.  You couldn't make out what the preacher said any
more, on account of the shouting and crying.  Folks got up
everywheres in the crowd, and worked their way just by main
strength to the mourners' bench, with the tears running down
their faces; and when all the mourners had got up there to the
front benches in a crowd, they sung and shouted and flung
themselves down on the straw, just crazy and wild.</p>

<p>Well, the first I knowed the king got a-going, and you could
hear him over everybody; and next he went a-charging up on to the
platform, and the preacher he begged him to speak to the people,
and he done it.  He told them he was a pirate&mdash;been a pirate
for thirty years out in the Indian Ocean&mdash;and his crew was
thinned out considerable last spring in a fight, and he was home
now to take out some fresh men, and thanks to goodness he'd been
robbed last night and put ashore off of a steamboat without a
cent, and he was glad of it; it was the blessedest thing that
ever happened to him, because he was a changed man now, and happy
for the first time in his life; and, poor as he was, he was going
to start right off and work his way back to the Indian Ocean, and
put in the rest of his life trying to turn the pirates into the
true path; for he could do it better than anybody else, being
acquainted with all pirate crews in that ocean; and though it
would take him a long time to get there without money, he would
get there anyway, and every time he convinced a pirate he would
say to him, "Don't you thank me, don't you give me no credit; it
all belongs to them dear people in Pokeville camp-meeting,
natural brothers and benefactors of the race, and that dear
preacher there, the truest friend a pirate ever had!"</p>

<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>


<p>And then he busted into tears, and so did everybody.  Then
somebody sings out, "Take up a collection for him, take up a
collection!"  Well, a half a dozen made a jump to do it, but somebody sings out, "Let HIM
pass the hat around!"  Then everybody said it, the preacher
too.</p>

<p>So the king went all through the crowd with his hat swabbing
his eyes, and blessing the people and praising them and thanking
them for being so good to the poor pirates away off there; and
every little while the prettiest kind of girls, with the tears
running down their cheeks, would up and ask him would he let them
kiss him for to remember him by; and he always done it; and some
of them he hugged and kissed as many as five or six
times&mdash;and he was invited to stay a week; and everybody
wanted him to live in their houses, and said they'd think it was
an honor; but he said as this was the last day of the
camp-meeting he couldn't do no good, and besides he was in a
sweat to get to the Indian Ocean right off and go to work on the
pirates.</p>

<p>When we got back to the raft and he come to count up he found
he had collected eighty-seven dollars and seventy-five cents.
 And then he had fetched away a three-gallon jug of whisky, too,
that he found under a wagon when he was starting home through the
woods.  The king said, take it all around, it laid over any day
he'd ever put in in the missionarying line.  He said it warn't no
use talking, heathens don't amount to shucks alongside of pirates
to work a camp-meeting with.</p>

<p>The duke was thinking HE'D been doing pretty well till the
king come to show up, but after that he didn't think so so much.
 He had set up and printed off two little jobs for farmers in
that printing-office&mdash;horse bills&mdash;and took the money,
four dollars.  And he had got in ten dollars' worth of
advertisements for the paper, which he said he would put in for
four dollars if they would pay in advance&mdash;so they done it.
The price of the paper was two dollars a year, but he took in
three subscriptions for half a dollar apiece on condition of them
paying him in advance; they were going to pay in cordwood and
onions as usual, but he said he had just bought the concern and
knocked down the price as low as he could afford it, and was
going to run it for cash.  He set up a little piece of poetry,
which he made, himself, out of his own head&mdash;three
verses&mdash;kind of sweet and saddish&mdash;the name of it was,
"Yes, crush, cold world, this breaking heart"&mdash;and he left
that all set up and ready to print in the paper, and didn't
charge nothing for it.  Well, he took in nine dollars and a half,
and said he'd done a pretty square day's work for it.</p>

<p>Then he showed us another little job he'd printed and hadn't
charged for, because it was for us.  It had a picture of a
runaway nigger with a bundle on a stick over his shoulder, and
"$200 reward" under it.  The reading was all about Jim, and just
described him to a dot.  It said he run away from St. Jacques'
plantation, forty mile below New Orleans, last winter, and likely
went north, and whoever would catch him and send him back he
could have the reward and expenses.</p>

<br>


<p>"Now," says the duke, "after to-night we can run in the
daytime if we want to.  Whenever we see anybody coming we can tie
Jim hand and foot with a rope, and lay him in the wigwam and show
this handbill and say we captured him up the river, and were too
poor to travel on a steamboat, so we got this little raft on
credit from our friends and are going down to get the reward.
 Handcuffs and chains would look still better on Jim, but it
wouldn't go well with the story of us being so poor.  Too much
like jewelry.  Ropes are the correct thing&mdash;we must preserve
the unities, as we say on the boards."</p>

<p>We all said the duke was pretty smart, and there couldn't be
no trouble about running daytimes.  We judged we could make miles
enough that night to get out of the reach of the powwow we
reckoned the duke's work in the printing office was going to make
in that little town; then we could boom right along if we wanted
to.</p>

<p>We laid low and kept still, and never shoved out till nearly
ten o'clock; then we slid by, pretty wide away from the town, and
didn't hoist our lantern till we was clear out of sight of
it.</p>

<p>When Jim called me to take the watch at four in the morning,
he says:</p>

<p>"Huck, does you reck'n we gwyne to run acrost any mo' kings on
dis trip?"</p>

<p>"No," I says, "I reckon not."</p>

<p>"Well," says he, "dat's all right, den.  I doan' mine one er
two kings, but dat's enough.  Dis one's powerful drunk, en de
duke ain' much better."</p>

<p>I found Jim had been trying to get him to talk French, so he
could hear what it was like; but he said he had been in this
country so long, and had so much trouble, he'd forgot it.</p>
