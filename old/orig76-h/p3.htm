<p>EXPLANATORY</p>

<p>IN this book a number of dialects are used, to wit:  the
Missouri negro dialect; the extremest form of the backwoods
Southwestern dialect; the ordinary "Pike County" dialect; and
four modified varieties of this last. The shadings have not been
done in a haphazard fashion, or by guesswork; but painstakingly,
and with the trustworthy guidance and support of personal
familiarity with these several forms of speech.</p>

<p>I make this explanation for the reason that without it many
readers would suppose that all these characters were trying to

CHAPTER XI.</p>

<p>"COME in," says the woman, and I did.  She says:  "Take a
cheer."</p>

<p>I done it.  She looked me all over with her little shiny eyes,
and says:</p>

<p>"What might your name be?"</p>

<p>"Sarah Williams."</p>

<p>"Where 'bouts do you live?  In this neighborhood?'</p>

<p>"No'm.  In Hookerville, seven mile below.  I've walked all the
way and I'm all tired out."</p>

<p>"Hungry, too, I reckon.  I'll find you something."</p>

<p>"No'm, I ain't hungry.  I was so hungry I had to stop two
miles below here at a farm; so I ain't hungry no more.  It's what
makes me so late. My mother's down sick, and out of money and
everything, and I come to tell my uncle Abner Moore.  He lives at
the upper end of the town, she says.  I hain't ever been here
before.  Do you know him?"</p>

<p>"No; but I don't know everybody yet.  I haven't lived here
quite two weeks. It's a considerable ways to the upper end of the
town.  You better stay here all night.  Take off your
bonnet."</p>

<p>"No," I says; "I'll rest a while, I reckon, and go on.  I
ain't afeared of the dark."</p>

<p>She said she wouldn't let me go by myself, but her husband
would be in by and by, maybe in a hour and a half, and she'd send
him along with me. Then she got to talking about her husband, and
about her relations up the river, and her relations down the
river, and about how much better off they used to was, and how
they didn't know but they'd made a mistake coming to our town,
instead of letting well alone&mdash;and so on and so on, till I
was afeard I had made a mistake coming to her to find out what
was going on in the town; but by and by she dropped on to pap and
the murder, and then I was pretty willing to let her clatter
right along.  She told about me and Tom Sawyer finding the six
thousand dollars (only she got it ten) and all about pap and what
a hard lot he was, and what a hard lot I was, and at last she got
down to where I was murdered.  I says:</p>

<p>"Who done it?  We've heard considerable about these goings on
down in Hookerville, but we don't know who 'twas that killed Huck
Finn."</p>

<p>"Well, I reckon there's a right smart chance of people HERE
that'd like to know who killed him.  Some think old Finn done it
himself."</p>

<p>"No&mdash;is that so?"</p>

<p>"Most everybody thought it at first.  He'll never know how
nigh he come to getting lynched.  But before night they changed
around and judged it was done by a runaway nigger named Jim."</p>

<p>"Why HE&mdash;"</p>

<p>I stopped.  I reckoned I better keep still.  She run on, and
never noticed I had put in at all:</p>

<p>"The nigger run off the very night Huck Finn was killed.  So
there's a reward out for him&mdash;three hundred dollars.  And
there's a reward out for old Finn, too&mdash;two hundred dollars.
 You see, he come to town the morning after the murder, and told
about it, and was out with 'em on the ferryboat hunt, and right
away after he up and left.  Before night they wanted to lynch
him, but he was gone, you see.  Well, next day they found out the
nigger was gone; they found out he hadn't ben seen sence ten
o'clock the night the murder was done.  So then they put it on
him, you see; and while they was full of it, next day, back comes
old Finn, and went boo-hooing to Judge Thatcher to get money to
hunt for the nigger all over Illinois with. The judge gave him
some, and that evening he got drunk, and was around till after
midnight with a couple of mighty hard-looking strangers, and
then went off with them.  Well, he hain't come back sence, and
they ain't looking for him back till this thing blows over a
little, for people thinks now that he killed his boy and fixed
things so folks would think robbers done it, and then he'd get
Huck's money without having to bother a long time with a lawsuit.
 People do say he warn't any too good to do it.  Oh, he's sly, I
reckon.  If he don't come back for a year he'll be all right.
 You can't prove anything on him, you know; everything will be
quieted down then, and he'll walk in Huck's money as easy as
nothing."</p>

<p>"Yes, I reckon so, 'm.  I don't see nothing in the way of it.
 Has everybody guit thinking the nigger done it?"</p>

<p>"Oh, no, not everybody.  A good many thinks he done it.  But
they'll get the nigger pretty soon now, and maybe they can scare
it out of him."</p>

<p>"Why, are they after him yet?"</p>

<p>"Well, you're innocent, ain't you!  Does three hundred dollars
lay around every day for people to pick up?  Some folks think the
nigger ain't far from here.  I'm one of them&mdash;but I hain't
talked it around.  A few days ago I was talking with an old
couple that lives next door in the log shanty, and they happened
to say hardly anybody ever goes to that island over yonder that
they call Jackson's Island.  Don't anybody live there? says I.
No, nobody, says they.  I didn't say any more, but I done some
thinking.  I was pretty near certain I'd seen smoke over there,
about the head of the island, a day or two before that, so I says
to myself, like as not that nigger's hiding over there; anyway,
says I, it's worth the trouble to give the place a hunt.  I
hain't seen any smoke sence, so I reckon maybe he's gone, if it
was him; but husband's going over to see&mdash;him and another
man.  He was gone up the river; but he got back to-day, and I
told him as soon as he got here two hours ago."</p>

<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<p>I had got so uneasy I couldn't set still.  I had to do
something with my hands; so I took up a needle off of the table
and went to threading it. My hands shook, and I was making a bad
job of it.  When the woman stopped talking I looked up, and she
was looking at me pretty curious and smiling a little.  I put
down the needle and thread, and let on to be
interested&mdash;and I was, too&mdash;and says:</p>

<p>"Three hundred dollars is a power of money.  I wish my mother
could get it. Is your husband going over there to-night?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes.  He went up-town with the man I was telling you of,
to get a boat and see if they could borrow another gun.  They'll
go over after midnight."</p>

<p>"Couldn't they see better if they was to wait till
daytime?"</p>

<p>"Yes.  And couldn't the nigger see better, too?  After
midnight he'll likely be asleep, and they can slip around through
the woods and hunt up his camp fire all the better for the dark,
if he's got one."</p>

<p>"I didn't think of that."</p>

<p>The woman kept looking at me pretty curious, and I didn't feel
a bit comfortable.  Pretty soon she says,</p>

<p>"What did you say your name was, honey?"</p>

<p>"M&mdash;Mary Williams."</p>

<p>Somehow it didn't seem to me that I said it was Mary before,
so I didn't look up&mdash;seemed to me I said it was Sarah; so I
felt sort of cornered, and was afeared maybe I was looking it,
too.  I wished the woman would say something more; the longer she
set still the uneasier I was.  But now she says:</p>

<p>"Honey, I thought you said it was Sarah when you first come
in?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes'm, I did.  Sarah Mary Williams.  Sarah's my first
name.  Some calls me Sarah, some calls me Mary."</p>

<p>"Oh, that's the way of it?"</p>

<p>"Yes'm."</p>

<p>I was feeling better then, but I wished I was out of there,
anyway.  I couldn't look up yet.</p>

<p>Well, the woman fell to talking about how hard times was, and
how poor they had to live, and how the rats was as free as if
they owned the place, and so forth and so on, and then I got easy
again.  She was right about the rats. You'd see one stick his
nose out of a hole in the corner every little while.  She said
she had to have things handy to throw at them when she was alone,
or they wouldn't give her no peace.  She showed me a bar of lead
twisted up into a knot, and said she was a good shot with it
generly, but she'd wrenched her arm a day or two ago, and didn't
know whether she could throw true now.  But she watched for a
chance, and directly banged away at a rat; but she missed him
wide, and said "Ouch!" it hurt her arm so.  Then she told me to
try for the next one.  I wanted to be getting away before the old
man got back, but of course I didn't let on.  I got the thing,
and the first rat that showed his nose I let drive, and if he'd a
stayed where he was he'd a been a tolerable sick rat.  She said
that was first-rate, and she reckoned I would hive the next one.
 She went and got the lump of lead and fetched it back, and
brought along a hank of yarn which she wanted me to help her
with.  I held up my two hands and she put the hank over them, and
went on talking about her and her husband's matters.  But she
broke off to say:</p>

<p>"Keep your eye on the rats.  You better have the lead in your
lap, handy."</p>

<p>So she dropped the lump into my lap just at that moment, and I
clapped my legs together on it and she went on talking.  But only
about a minute. Then she took off the hank and looked me straight
in the face, and very pleasant, and says:</p>

<p>"Come, now, what's your real name?"</p>

<p>"Wh&mdash;what, mum?"</p>

<p>"What's your real name?  Is it Bill, or Tom, or Bob?&mdash;or
what is it?"</p>

<p>I reckon I shook like a leaf, and I didn't know hardly what to
do.  But I says:</p>

<p>"Please to don't poke fun at a poor girl like me, mum.  If I'm
in the way here, I'll&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No, you won't.  Set down and stay where you are.  I ain't
going to hurt you, and I ain't going to tell on you, nuther.  You
just tell me your secret, and trust me.  I'll keep it; and,
what's more, I'll help you. So'll my old man if you want him to.
 You see, you're a runaway 'prentice, that's all.  It ain't
anything.  There ain't no harm in it. You've been treated bad,
and you made up your mind to cut.  Bless you, child, I wouldn't
tell on you.  Tell me all about it now, that's a good boy."</p>

<p>So I said it wouldn't be no use to try to play it any longer,
and I would just make a clean breast and tell her everything, but
she musn't go back on her promise.  Then I told her my father and
mother was dead, and the law had bound me out to a mean old
farmer in the country thirty mile back from the river, and he
treated me so bad I couldn't stand it no longer; he went away to
be gone a couple of days, and so I took my chance and stole some
of his daughter's old clothes and cleared out, and I had been
three nights coming the thirty miles.  I traveled nights, and hid
daytimes and slept, and the bag of bread and meat I carried from
home lasted me all the way, and I had a-plenty.  I said I
believed my uncle Abner Moore would take care of me, and so that
was why I struck out for this town of Goshen.</p>

<p>"Goshen, child?  This ain't Goshen.  This is St. Petersburg.
 Goshen's ten mile further up the river.  Who told you this was
Goshen?"</p>

<p>"Why, a man I met at daybreak this morning, just as I was
going to turn into the woods for my regular sleep.  He told me
when the roads forked I must take the right hand, and five mile
would fetch me to Goshen."</p>

<p>"He was drunk, I reckon.  He told you just exactly wrong."</p>

<p>"Well, he did act like he was drunk, but it ain't no matter
now.  I got to be moving along.  I'll fetch Goshen before
daylight."</p>

<p>"Hold on a minute.  I'll put you up a snack to eat.  You might
want it."</p>

<br>
<br>
<a name="c11-90"></a>
<br>
<br>

<img alt="c11-90.jpg (57K)" src="images/c11-90.jpg" height="609" width="438">
</center>

<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

<p>So she put me up a snack, and says:</p>

<p>"Say, when a cow's laying down, which end of her gets up
first?  Answer up prompt now&mdash;don't stop to study over it.
 Which end gets up first?"</p>

<p>"The hind end, mum."</p>

<p>"Well, then, a horse?"</p>

<p>"The for'rard end, mum."</p>

<p>"Which side of a tree does the moss grow on?"</p>

<p>"North side."</p>

<p>"If fifteen cows is browsing on a hillside, how many of them
eats with their heads pointed the same direction?"</p>

<p>"The whole fifteen, mum."</p>

<p>"Well, I reckon you HAVE lived in the country.  I thought
maybe you was trying to hocus me again.  What's your real name,
now?"</p>

<p>"George Peters, mum."</p>

<p>"Well, try to remember it, George.  Don't forget and tell me
it's Elexander before you go, and then get out by saying it's
George Elexander when I catch you.  And don't go about women in
that old calico.  You do a girl tolerable poor, but you might
fool men, maybe.  Bless you, child, when you set out to thread a
needle don't hold the thread still and fetch the needle up to it;
hold the needle still and poke the thread at it; that's the way a
woman most always does, but a man always does t'other way.  And
when you throw at a rat or anything, hitch yourself up a tiptoe
and fetch your hand up over your head as awkward as you can, and
miss your rat about six or seven foot. Throw stiff-armed from the
shoulder, like there was a pivot there for it to turn on, like a
girl; not from the wrist and elbow, with your arm out to one
side, like a boy.  And, mind you, when a girl tries to catch
anything in her lap she throws her knees apart; she don't clap
them together, the way you did when you catched the lump of lead.
 Why, I spotted you for a boy when you was threading the needle;
and I contrived the other things just to make certain.  Now trot
along to your uncle, Sarah Mary Williams George Elexander Peters,
and if you get into trouble you send word to Mrs. Judith Loftus,
which is me, and I'll do what I can to get you out of it.  Keep
the river road all the way, and next time you tramp take shoes
and socks with you. The river road's a rocky one, and your
feet'll be in a condition when you get to Goshen, I reckon."</p>

<p>I went up the bank about fifty yards, and then I doubled on my
tracks and slipped back to where my canoe was, a good piece below
the house.  I jumped in, and was off in a hurry.  I went
up-stream far enough to make the head of the island, and then
started across.  I took off the sun-bonnet, for I didn't want no
blinders on then.  When I was about the middle I heard the clock
begin to strike, so I stops and listens; the sound come faint
over the water but clear&mdash;eleven.  When I struck the head of
the island I never waited to blow, though I was most winded, but
I shoved right into the timber where my old camp used to be, and
started a good fire there on a high and dry spot.</p>

<p>Then I jumped in the canoe and dug out for our place, a mile
and a half below, as hard as I could go.  I landed, and slopped
through the timber and up the ridge and into the cavern.  There
Jim laid, sound asleep on the ground.  I roused him out and
says:</p>

<p>"Git up and hump yourself, Jim!  There ain't a minute to lose.
 They're after us!"</p>

<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>


<p>Jim never asked no questions, he never said a word; but the
way he worked for the next half an hour showed about how he was
scared.  By that time everything we had in the world was on our
raft, and she was ready to be shoved out from the willow cove
where she was hid.  We put out the camp fire at the cavern the
first thing, and didn't show a candle outside after that.</p>

<p>I took the canoe out from the shore a little piece, and took a
look; but if there was a boat around I couldn't see it, for stars
and shadows ain't good to see by.  Then we got out the raft and
slipped along down in the shade, past the foot of the island dead
still&mdash;never saying a word.</p>

<br>
<br>
CHAPTER XII.</p>

<p>IT must a been close on to one o'clock when we got below the
island at last, and the raft did seem to go mighty slow.  If a
boat was to come along we was going to take to the canoe and
break for the Illinois shore; and it was well a boat didn't come,
for we hadn't ever thought to put the gun in the canoe, or a
fishing-line, or anything to eat.  We was in ruther too much of a
sweat to think of so many things.  It warn't good judgment to put
EVERYTHING on the raft.</p>

<p>If the men went to the island I just expect they found the
camp fire I built, and watched it all night for Jim to come.
 Anyways, they stayed away from us, and if my building the fire
never fooled them it warn't no fault of mine.  I played it as low
down on them as I could.</p>

<p>When the first streak of day began to show we tied up to a
towhead in a big bend on the Illinois side, and hacked off
cottonwood branches with the hatchet, and covered up the raft
with them so she looked like there had been a cave-in in the bank
there.  A tow-head is a sandbar that has cottonwoods on it as
thick as harrow-teeth.</p>

<p>We had mountains on the Missouri shore and heavy timber on the
Illinois side, and the channel was down the Missouri shore at
that place, so we warn't afraid of anybody running across us.  We
laid there all day, and watched the rafts and steamboats spin
down the Missouri shore, and up-bound steamboats fight the big
river in the middle.  I told Jim all about the time I had
jabbering with that woman; and Jim said she was a smart one, and
if she was to start after us herself she wouldn't set down and
watch a camp fire&mdash;no, sir, she'd fetch a dog.  Well, then,
I said, why couldn't she tell her husband to fetch a dog?  Jim
said he bet she did think of it by the time the men was ready to
start, and he believed they must a gone up-town to get a dog and
so they lost all that time, or else we wouldn't be here on a
towhead sixteen or seventeen mile below the village&mdash;no,
indeedy, we would be in that same old town again.  So I said I
didn't care what was the reason they didn't get us as long as
they didn't.</p>

<p>When it was beginning to come on dark we poked our heads out
of the cottonwood thicket, and looked up and down and across;
nothing in sight; so Jim took up some of the top planks of the
raft and built a snug wigwam to get under in blazing weather and
rainy, and to keep the things dry. Jim made a floor for the
wigwam, and raised it a foot or more above the level of the raft,
so now the blankets and all the traps was out of reach of
steamboat waves.  Right in the middle of the wigwam we made a
layer of dirt about five or six inches deep with a frame around
it for to hold it to its place; this was to build a fire on in
sloppy weather or chilly; the wigwam would keep it from being
seen.  We made an extra steering-oar, too, because one of the
others might get broke on a snag or something. We fixed up a
short forked stick to hang the old lantern on, because we must
always light the lantern whenever we see a steamboat coming
down-stream, to keep from getting run over; but we wouldn't have to
light it for up-stream boats unless we see we was in what they
call a "crossing"; for the river was pretty high yet, very low
banks being still a little under water; so up-bound boats didn't
always run the channel, but hunted easy water.</p>

<p>This second night we run between seven and eight hours, with a
current that was making over four mile an hour.  We catched fish
and talked, and we took a swim now and then to keep off
sleepiness.  It was kind of solemn, drifting down the big, still
river, laying on our backs looking up at the stars, and we didn't
ever feel like talking loud, and it warn't often that we
laughed&mdash;only a little kind of a low chuckle.  We had mighty
good weather as a general thing, and nothing ever happened to us
at all&mdash;that night, nor the next, nor the next.</p>

<p>Every night we passed towns, some of them away up on black
hillsides, nothing but just a shiny bed of lights; not a house
could you see.  The fifth night we passed St. Louis, and it was
like the whole world lit up. In St. Petersburg they used to say
there was twenty or thirty thousand people in St. Louis, but I
never believed it till I see that wonderful spread of lights at
two o'clock that still night.  There warn't a sound there;
everybody was asleep.</p>

<p>Every night now I used to slip ashore towards ten o'clock at
some little village, and buy ten or fifteen cents' worth of meal
or bacon or other stuff to eat; and sometimes I lifted a chicken
that warn't roosting comfortable, and took him along.  Pap always
said, take a chicken when you get a chance, because if you don't
want him yourself you can easy find somebody that does, and a
good deed ain't ever forgot.  I never see pap when he didn't want
the chicken himself, but that is what he used to say, anyway.</p>

<br>
<br>

<p>Mornings before daylight I slipped into cornfields and
borrowed a watermelon, or a mushmelon, or a punkin, or some new
corn, or things of that kind.  Pap always said it warn't no harm
to borrow things if you was meaning to pay them back some time;
but the widow said it warn't anything but a soft name for
stealing, and no decent body would do it.  Jim said he reckoned
the widow was partly right and pap was partly right; so the best
way would be for us to pick out two or three things from the list
and say we wouldn't borrow them any more&mdash;then he reckoned
it wouldn't be no harm to borrow the others.  So we talked it
over all one night, drifting along down the river, trying to make
up our minds whether to drop the watermelons, or the cantelopes,
or the mushmelons, or what.  But towards daylight we got it all
settled satisfactory, and concluded to drop crabapples and
p'simmons.  We warn't feeling just right before that, but it was
all comfortable now.  I was glad the way it come out, too,
because crabapples ain't ever good, and the p'simmons wouldn't be
ripe for two or three months yet.</p>

<p>We shot a water-fowl now and then that got up too early in the
morning or didn't go to bed early enough in the evening.  Take it
all round, we lived pretty high.</p>

<p>The fifth night below St. Louis we had a big storm after
midnight, with a power of thunder and lightning, and the rain
poured down in a solid sheet. We stayed in the wigwam and let the
raft take care of itself. When the lightning glared out we could
see a big straight river ahead, and high, rocky bluffs on both
sides.  By and by says I, "Hel-LO, Jim, looky yonder!" It was a
steamboat that had killed herself on a rock.  We was drifting
straight down for her.  The lightning showed her very distinct.
 She was leaning over, with part of her upper deck above water,
and you could see every little chimbly-guy clean and clear, and a
chair by the big bell, with an old slouch hat hanging on the back
of it, when the flashes come.</p>

<p>Well, it being away in the night and stormy, and all so
mysterious-like, I felt just the way any other boy would a felt
when I see that wreck laying there so mournful and lonesome in
the middle of the river.  I wanted to get aboard of her and slink
around a little, and see what there was there.  So I says:</p>

<p>"Le's land on her, Jim."</p>

<p>But Jim was dead against it at first.  He says:</p>

<p>"I doan' want to go fool'n 'long er no wrack.  We's doin'
blame' well, en we better let blame' well alone, as de good book
says.  Like as not dey's a watchman on dat wrack."</p>

<p>"Watchman your grandmother," I says; "there ain't nothing to
watch but the texas and the pilot-house; and do you reckon
anybody's going to resk his life for a texas and a pilot-house
such a night as this, when it's likely to break up and wash off
down the river any minute?"  Jim couldn't say nothing to that, so
he didn't try.  "And besides," I says, "we might borrow something
worth having out of the captain's stateroom.  Seegars, I bet
you&mdash;and cost five cents apiece, solid cash.  Steamboat
captains is always rich, and get sixty dollars a month, and THEY
don't care a cent what a thing costs, you know, long as they want
it.  Stick a candle in your pocket; I can't rest, Jim, till we
give her a rummaging.  Do you reckon Tom Sawyer would ever go by
this thing?  Not for pie, he wouldn't. He'd call it an
adventure&mdash;that's what he'd call it; and he'd land on that
wreck if it was his last act.  And wouldn't he throw style into
it?&mdash;wouldn't he spread himself, nor nothing?  Why, you'd
think it was Christopher C'lumbus discovering Kingdom-Come.  I
wish Tom Sawyer WAS here."</p>

<p>Jim he grumbled a little, but give in.  He said we mustn't
talk any more than we could help, and then talk mighty low.  The
lightning showed us the wreck again just in time, and we fetched
the stabboard derrick, and made fast there.</p>

<p>The deck was high out here.  We went sneaking down the slope
of it to labboard, in the dark, towards the texas, feeling our
way slow with our feet, and spreading our hands out to fend off
the guys, for it was so dark we couldn't see no sign of them.
 Pretty soon we struck the forward end of the skylight, and clumb
on to it; and the next step fetched us in front of the captain's
door, which was open, and by Jimminy, away down through the
texas-hall we see a light! and all in the same second we seem to
hear low voices in yonder!</p>

<p>Jim whispered and said he was feeling powerful sick, and told
me to come along.  I says, all right, and was going to start for
the raft; but just then I heard a voice wail out and say:</p>

<p>"Oh, please don't, boys; I swear I won't ever tell!"</p>

<p>Another voice said, pretty loud:</p>

<p>"It's a lie, Jim Turner.  You've acted this way before.  You
always want more'n your share of the truck, and you've always got
it, too, because you've swore 't if you didn't you'd tell.  But
this time you've said it jest one time too many.  You're the
meanest, treacherousest hound in this country."</p>

<p>By this time Jim was gone for the raft.  I was just a-biling
with curiosity; and I says to myself, Tom Sawyer wouldn't back
out now, and so I won't either; I'm a-going to see what's going
on here.  So I dropped on my hands and knees in the little
passage, and crept aft in the dark till there warn't but one
stateroom betwixt me and the cross-hall of the texas.  Then in
there I see a man stretched on the floor and tied hand and foot,
and two men standing over him, and one of them had a dim lantern
in his hand, and the other one had a pistol.  This one kept
pointing the pistol at the man's head on the floor, and
saying:</p>

<p>"I'd LIKE to!  And I orter, too&mdash;a mean skunk!"</p>

<br>

</center>

<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

<p>The man on the floor would shrivel up and say, "Oh, please
don't, Bill; I hain't ever goin' to tell."</p>

<p>And every time he said that the man with the lantern would
laugh and say:</p>

<p>"'Deed you AIN'T!  You never said no truer thing 'n that, you
bet you." And once he said:  "Hear him beg! and yit if we hadn't
got the best of him and tied him he'd a killed us both.  And what
FOR?  Jist for noth'n. Jist because we stood on our
RIGHTS&mdash;that's what for.  But I lay you ain't a-goin' to
threaten nobody any more, Jim Turner.  Put UP that pistol,
Bill."</p>

<p>Bill says:</p>

<p>"I don't want to, Jake Packard.  I'm for killin' him&mdash;and
didn't he kill old Hatfield jist the same way&mdash;and don't he
deserve it?"</p>

<p>"But I don't WANT him killed, and I've got my reasons for
it."</p>

<p>"Bless yo' heart for them words, Jake Packard!  I'll never
forgit you long's I live!" says the man on the floor, sort of
blubbering.</p>

<p>Packard didn't take no notice of that, but hung up his lantern
on a nail and started towards where I was there in the dark, and
motioned Bill to come.  I crawfished as fast as I could about two
yards, but the boat slanted so that I couldn't make very good
time; so to keep from getting run over and catched I crawled into
a stateroom on the upper side.  The man came a-pawing along in
the dark, and when Packard got to my stateroom, he says:</p>

<p>"Here&mdash;come in here."</p>

<p>And in he come, and Bill after him.  But before they got in I
was up in the upper berth, cornered, and sorry I come.  Then they
stood there, with their hands on the ledge of the berth, and
talked.  I couldn't see them, but I could tell where they was by
the whisky they'd been having.  I was glad I didn't drink whisky;
but it wouldn't made much difference anyway, because most of the
time they couldn't a treed me because I didn't breathe.  I was
too scared.  And, besides, a body COULDN'T breathe and hear such
talk.  They talked low and earnest.  Bill wanted to kill Turner.
 He says:</p>

<p>"He's said he'll tell, and he will.  If we was to give both
our shares to him NOW it wouldn't make no difference after the
row and the way we've served him.  Shore's you're born, he'll
turn State's evidence; now you hear ME.  I'm for putting him out
of his troubles."</p>

<p>"So'm I," says Packard, very quiet.</p>

<p>"Blame it, I'd sorter begun to think you wasn't.  Well, then,
that's all right.  Le's go and do it."</p>

<p>"Hold on a minute; I hain't had my say yit.  You listen to me.
Shooting's good, but there's quieter ways if the thing's GOT to
be done. But what I say is this:  it ain't good sense to go
court'n around after a halter if you can git at what you're up to
in some way that's jist as good and at the same time don't bring
you into no resks.  Ain't that so?"</p>

<p>"You bet it is.  But how you goin' to manage it this
time?"</p>

<p>"Well, my idea is this:  we'll rustle around and gather up
whatever pickins we've overlooked in the staterooms, and shove
for shore and hide the truck. Then we'll wait.  Now I say it
ain't a-goin' to be more'n two hours befo' this wrack breaks up
and washes off down the river.  See? He'll be drownded, and won't
have nobody to blame for it but his own self.  I reckon that's a
considerble sight better 'n killin' of him.  I'm unfavorable to
killin' a man as long as you can git aroun' it; it ain't good
sense, it ain't good morals.  Ain't I right?"</p>

<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

<p>"Yes, I reck'n you are.  But s'pose she DON'T break up and
wash off?"</p>

<p>"Well, we can wait the two hours anyway and see, can't
we?"</p>

<p>"All right, then; come along."</p>

<p>So they started, and I lit out, all in a cold sweat, and
scrambled forward. It was dark as pitch there; but I said, in a
kind of a coarse whisper, "Jim!" and he answered up, right at my
elbow, with a sort of a moan, and I says:</p>

<p>"Quick, Jim, it ain't no time for fooling around and moaning;
there's a gang of murderers in yonder, and if we don't hunt up
their boat and set her drifting down the river so these fellows
can't get away from the wreck there's one of 'em going to be in a
bad fix.  But if we find their boat we can put ALL of 'em in a
bad fix&mdash;for the sheriff 'll get 'em. Quick&mdash;hurry!
 I'll hunt the labboard side, you hunt the stabboard. You start
at the raft, and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, my lordy, lordy!  RAF'?  Dey ain' no raf' no mo'; she
done broke loose en gone I&mdash;en here we is!"</p>

CHAPTER XIII.</p>

<p>WELL, I catched my breath and most fainted.  Shut up on a
wreck with such a gang as that!  But it warn't no time to be
sentimentering.  We'd GOT to find that boat now&mdash;had to have
it for ourselves.  So we went a-quaking and shaking down the
stabboard side, and slow work it was, too&mdash;seemed a week
before we got to the stern.  No sign of a boat.  Jim said he
didn't believe he could go any further&mdash;so scared he hadn't
hardly any strength left, he said.  But I said, come on, if we
get left on this wreck we are in a fix, sure.  So on we prowled
again.  We struck for the stern of the texas, and found it, and
then scrabbled along forwards on the skylight, hanging on from
shutter to shutter, for the edge of the skylight was in the
water.  When we got pretty close to the cross-hall door there was
the skiff, sure enough!  I could just barely see her.  I felt
ever so thankful.  In another second I would a been aboard of
her, but just then the door opened.  One of the men stuck his
head out only about a couple of foot from me, and I thought I was
gone; but he jerked it in again, and says:</p>

<p>"Heave that blame lantern out o' sight, Bill!"</p>

<p>He flung a bag of something into the boat, and then got in
himself and set down.  It was Packard.  Then Bill HE come out and
got in.  Packard says, in a low voice:</p>

<p>"All ready&mdash;shove off!"</p>

<p>I couldn't hardly hang on to the shutters, I was so weak.  But
Bill says:</p>

<p>"Hold on&mdash;'d you go through him?"</p>

<p>"No.  Didn't you?"</p>

<p>"No.  So he's got his share o' the cash yet."</p>

<p>"Well, then, come along; no use to take truck and leave
money."</p>

<p>"Say, won't he suspicion what we're up to?"</p>

<p>"Maybe he won't.  But we got to have it anyway. Come
along."</p>

<p>So they got out and went in.</p>

<p>The door slammed to because it was on the careened side; and
in a half second I was in the boat, and Jim come tumbling after
me.  I out with my knife and cut the rope, and away we went!</p>

<p>We didn't touch an oar, and we didn't speak nor whisper, nor
hardly even breathe.  We went gliding swift along, dead silent,
past the tip of the paddle-box, and past the stern; then in a
second or two more we was a hundred yards below the wreck, and
the darkness soaked her up, every last sign of her, and we was
safe, and knowed it.</p>

<p>When we was three or four hundred yards down-stream we see the
lantern show like a little spark at the texas door for a second,
and we knowed by that that the rascals had missed their boat, and
was beginning to understand that they was in just as much trouble
now as Jim Turner was.</p>

<p>Then Jim manned the oars, and we took out after our raft.  Now
was the first time that I begun to worry about the men&mdash;I
reckon I hadn't had time to before.  I begun to think how
dreadful it was, even for murderers, to be in such a fix.  I says
to myself, there ain't no telling but I might come to be a
murderer myself yet, and then how would I like it?  So says I to
Jim:</p>

<p>"The first light we see we'll land a hundred yards below it or
above it, in a place where it's a good hiding-place for you and
the skiff, and then I'll go and fix up some kind of a yarn, and
get somebody to go for that gang and get them out of their
scrape, so they can be hung when their time comes."</p>

<p>But that idea was a failure; for pretty soon it begun to storm
again, and this time worse than ever.  The rain poured down, and
never a light showed; everybody in bed, I reckon.  We boomed
along down the river, watching for lights and watching for our
raft.  After a long time the rain let up, but the clouds stayed,
and the lightning kept whimpering, and by and by a flash showed
us a black thing ahead, floating, and we made for it.</p>

<p>It was the raft, and mighty glad was we to get aboard of it
again.  We seen a light now away down to the right, on shore.  So
I said I would go for it. The skiff was half full of plunder
which that gang had stole there on the wreck.  We hustled it on
to the raft in a pile, and I told Jim to float along down, and
show a light when he judged he had gone about two mile, and keep
it burning till I come; then I manned my oars and shoved for the
light.  As I got down towards it three or four more
showed&mdash;up on a hillside.  It was a village.  I closed in
above the shore light, and laid on my oars and floated.  As I
went by I see it was a lantern hanging on the jackstaff of a
double-hull ferryboat.  I skimmed around for the watchman,
a-wondering whereabouts he slept; and by and by I found him
roosting on the bitts forward, with his head down between his
knees.  I gave his shoulder two or three little shoves, and begun
to cry.</p>

<p>He stirred up in a kind of a startlish way; but when he see it
was only me he took a good gap and stretch, and then he says:</p>

<p>"Hello, what's up?  Don't cry, bub.  What's the trouble?"</p>

<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

<p>I says:</p>

<p>"Pap, and mam, and sis, and&mdash;"</p>

<p>Then I broke down.  He says:</p>

<p>"Oh, dang it now, DON'T take on so; we all has to have our
troubles, and this 'n 'll come out all right.  What's the matter
with 'em?"</p>

<p>"They're&mdash;they're&mdash;are you the watchman of the
boat?"</p>

<p>"Yes," he says, kind of pretty-well-satisfied like.  "I'm the
captain and the owner and the mate and the pilot and watchman and
head deck-hand; and sometimes I'm the freight and passengers.  I
ain't as rich as old Jim Hornback, and I can't be so blame'
generous and good to Tom, Dick, and Harry as what he is, and slam
around money the way he does; but I've told him a many a time 't
I wouldn't trade places with him; for, says I, a sailor's life's
the life for me, and I'm derned if I'D live two mile out o' town,
where there ain't nothing ever goin' on, not for all his
spondulicks and as much more on top of it.  Says I&mdash;"</p>

<p>I broke in and says:</p>

<p>"They're in an awful peck of trouble, and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"WHO is?"</p>

<p>"Why, pap and mam and sis and Miss Hooker; and if you'd take
your ferryboat and go up there&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Up where?  Where are they?"</p>

<p>"On the wreck."</p>

<p>"What wreck?"</p>

<p>"Why, there ain't but one."</p>

<p>"What, you don't mean the Walter Scott?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Good land! what are they doin' THERE, for gracious
sakes?"</p>

<p>"Well, they didn't go there a-purpose."</p>

<p>"I bet they didn't!  Why, great goodness, there ain't no
chance for 'em if they don't git off mighty quick!  Why, how in
the nation did they ever git into such a scrape?"</p>

<p>"Easy enough.  Miss Hooker was a-visiting up there to the
town&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes, Booth's Landing&mdash;go on."</p>

<p>"She was a-visiting there at Booth's Landing, and just in the
edge of the evening she started over with her nigger woman in the
horse-ferry to stay all night at her friend's house, Miss
What-you-may-call-her I disremember her name&mdash;and they lost
their steering-oar, and swung around and went a-floating down,
stern first, about two mile, and saddle-baggsed on the wreck, and
the ferryman and the nigger woman and the horses was all lost,
but Miss Hooker she made a grab and got aboard the wreck.  Well,
about an hour after dark we come along down in our trading-scow,
and it was so dark we didn't notice the wreck till we was right
on it; and so WE saddle-baggsed; but all of us was saved but Bill
Whipple&mdash;and oh, he WAS the best cretur!&mdash;I most wish
't it had been me, I do."</p>

<p>"My George!  It's the beatenest thing I ever struck.  And THEN
what did you all do?"</p>

<p>"Well, we hollered and took on, but it's so wide there we
couldn't make nobody hear.  So pap said somebody got to get
ashore and get help somehow. I was the only one that could swim,
so I made a dash for it, and Miss Hooker she said if I didn't
strike help sooner, come here and hunt up her uncle, and he'd fix
the thing.  I made the land about a mile below, and been fooling
along ever since, trying to get people to do something, but they
said, 'What, in such a night and such a current? There ain't no
sense in it; go for the steam ferry.'  Now if you'll go
and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"By Jackson, I'd LIKE to, and, blame it, I don't know but I
will; but who in the dingnation's a-going' to PAY for it?  Do you
reckon your pap&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Why THAT'S all right.  Miss Hooker she tole me, PARTICULAR,
that her uncle Hornback&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Great guns! is HE her uncle?  Looky here, you break for that
light over yonder-way, and turn out west when you git there, and
about a quarter of a mile out you'll come to the tavern; tell 'em
to dart you out to Jim Hornback's, and he'll foot the bill.  And
don't you fool around any, because he'll want to know the news.
 Tell him I'll have his niece all safe before he can get to town.
 Hump yourself, now; I'm a-going up around the corner here to
roust out my engineer."</p>

<p>I struck for the light, but as soon as he turned the corner I
went back and got into my skiff and bailed her out, and then
pulled up shore in the easy water about six hundred yards, and
tucked myself in among some woodboats; for I couldn't rest easy
till I could see the ferryboat start. But take it all around, I
was feeling ruther comfortable on accounts of taking all this
trouble for that gang, for not many would a done it.  I wished
the widow knowed about it.  I judged she would be proud of me for
helping these rapscallions, because rapscallions and dead beats
is the kind the widow and good people takes the most interest
in.</p>

<br>
<br>
<br>

<p>Well, before long here comes the wreck, dim and dusky, sliding
along down! A kind of cold shiver went through me, and then I
struck out for her.  She was very deep, and I see in a minute
there warn't much chance for anybody being alive in her.  I
pulled all around her and hollered a little, but there wasn't any
answer; all dead still.  I felt a little bit heavy-hearted about
the gang, but not much, for I reckoned if they could stand it I
could.</p>

<p>Then here comes the ferryboat; so I shoved for the middle of
the river on a long down-stream slant; and when I judged I was
out of eye-reach I laid on my oars, and looked back and see her
go and smell around the wreck for Miss Hooker's remainders,
because the captain would know her uncle Hornback would want
them; and then pretty soon the ferryboat give it up and went for
the shore, and I laid into my work and went a-booming down the
river.</p>

<p>It did seem a powerful long time before Jim's light showed up;
and when it did show it looked like it was a thousand mile off.
 By the time I got there the sky was beginning to get a little
gray in the east; so we struck for an island, and hid the raft,
and sunk the skiff, and turned in and slept like dead people.</p>

CHAPTER XIV.</p>

<p>BY and by, when we got up, we turned over the truck the gang
had stole off of the wreck, and found boots, and blankets, and
clothes, and all sorts of other things, and a lot of books, and a
spyglass, and three boxes of seegars.  We hadn't ever been this
rich before in neither of our lives.  The seegars was prime.  We
laid off all the afternoon in the woods talking, and me reading
the books, and having a general good time. I told Jim all about
what happened inside the wreck and at the ferryboat, and I said
these kinds of things was adventures; but he said he didn't want
no more adventures.  He said that when I went in the texas and he
crawled back to get on the raft and found her gone he nearly
died, because he judged it was all up with HIM anyway it could be
fixed; for if he didn't get saved he would get drownded; and if
he did get saved, whoever saved him would send him back home so
as to get the reward, and then Miss Watson would sell him South,
sure.  Well, he was right; he was most always right; he had an
uncommon level head for a nigger.</p>

<p>I read considerable to Jim about kings and dukes and earls and
such, and how gaudy they dressed, and how much style they put on,
and called each other your majesty, and your grace, and your
lordship, and so on, 'stead of mister; and Jim's eyes bugged out,
and he was interested.  He says:</p>

<p>"I didn' know dey was so many un um.  I hain't hearn 'bout
none un um, skasely, but ole King Sollermun, onless you counts
dem kings dat's in a pack er k'yards.  How much do a king
git?"</p>

<p>"Get?"  I says; "why, they get a thousand dollars a month if
they want it; they can have just as much as they want; everything
belongs to them."</p>

<p>"AIN' dat gay?  En what dey got to do, Huck?"</p>

<p>"THEY don't do nothing!  Why, how you talk! They just set
around."</p>

<p>"No; is dat so?"</p>

<p>"Of course it is.  They just set around&mdash;except, maybe,
when there's a war; then they go to the war.  But other times
they just lazy around; or go hawking&mdash;just hawking and
sp&mdash;Sh!&mdash;d' you hear a noise?"</p>

<p>We skipped out and looked; but it warn't nothing but the
flutter of a steamboat's wheel away down, coming around the
point; so we come back.</p>

<p>"Yes," says I, "and other times, when things is dull, they
fuss with the parlyment; and if everybody don't go just so he
whacks their heads off. But mostly they hang round the
harem."</p>

<p>"Roun' de which?"</p>

<p>"Harem."</p>

<p>"What's de harem?"</p>

<br>
<br>

<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

<p>"The place where he keeps his wives.  Don't you know about the
harem? Solomon had one; he had about a million wives."</p>

<p>"Why, yes, dat's so; I&mdash;I'd done forgot it.  A harem's a
bo'd'n-house, I reck'n.  Mos' likely dey has rackety times in de
nussery.  En I reck'n de wives quarrels considable; en dat
'crease de racket.  Yit dey say Sollermun de wises' man dat ever
live'.  I doan' take no stock in dat. Bekase why: would a wise
man want to live in de mids' er sich a blim-blammin' all de
time?  No&mdash;'deed he wouldn't.  A wise man 'ud take en buil'
a biler-factry; en den he could shet DOWN de biler-factry when he
want to res'."</p>

<p>"Well, but he WAS the wisest man, anyway; because the widow
she told me so, her own self."</p>

<p>"I doan k'yer what de widder say, he WARN'T no wise man
nuther.  He had some er de dad-fetchedes' ways I ever see.  Does
you know 'bout dat chile dat he 'uz gwyne to chop in two?"</p>

<p>"Yes, the widow told me all about it."</p>

<p>"WELL, den!  Warn' dat de beatenes' notion in de worl'?  You
jes' take en look at it a minute.  Dah's de stump,
dah&mdash;dat's one er de women; heah's you&mdash;dat's de yuther
one; I's Sollermun; en dish yer dollar bill's de chile.  Bofe un
you claims it.  What does I do?  Does I shin aroun' mongs' de
neighbors en fine out which un you de bill DO b'long to, en han'
it over to de right one, all safe en soun', de way dat anybody
dat had any gumption would?  No; I take en whack de bill in TWO,
en give half un it to you, en de yuther half to de yuther woman.
 Dat's de way Sollermun was gwyne to do wid de chile.  Now I want
to ast you:  what's de use er dat half a bill?&mdash;can't buy
noth'n wid it.  En what use is a half a chile?  I wouldn' give a
dern for a million un um."</p>

<p>"But hang it, Jim, you've clean missed the point&mdash;blame
it, you've missed it a thousand mile."</p>

<p>"Who?  Me?  Go 'long.  Doan' talk to me 'bout yo' pints.  I
reck'n I knows sense when I sees it; en dey ain' no sense in sich
doin's as dat. De 'spute warn't 'bout a half a chile, de 'spute
was 'bout a whole chile; en de man dat think he kin settle a
'spute 'bout a whole chile wid a half a chile doan' know enough
to come in out'n de rain.  Doan' talk to me 'bout Sollermun,
Huck, I knows him by de back."</p>

</center>

<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>


<p>"But I tell you you don't get the point."</p>

<p>"Blame de point!  I reck'n I knows what I knows.  En mine you,
de REAL pint is down furder&mdash;it's down deeper.  It lays in
de way Sollermun was raised.  You take a man dat's got on'y one
or two chillen; is dat man gwyne to be waseful o' chillen?  No,
he ain't; he can't 'ford it.  HE know how to value 'em.  But you
take a man dat's got 'bout five million chillen runnin' roun' de
house, en it's diffunt.  HE as soon chop a chile in two as a cat.
Dey's plenty mo'.  A chile er two, mo' er less, warn't no
consekens to Sollermun, dad fatch him!"</p>

<p>I never see such a nigger.  If he got a notion in his head
once, there warn't no getting it out again.  He was the most down
on Solomon of any nigger I ever see.  So I went to talking about
other kings, and let Solomon slide.  I told about Louis Sixteenth
that got his head cut off in France long time ago; and about his
little boy the dolphin, that would a been a king, but they took
and shut him up in jail, and some say he died there.</p>

<p>"Po' little chap."</p>

<p>"But some says he got out and got away, and come to
America."</p>

<p>"Dat's good!  But he'll be pooty lonesome&mdash;dey ain' no
kings here, is dey, Huck?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"Den he cain't git no situation.  What he gwyne to do?"</p>

<p>"Well, I don't know.  Some of them gets on the police, and
some of them learns people how to talk French."</p>

<p>"Why, Huck, doan' de French people talk de same way we
does?"</p>

<p>"NO, Jim; you couldn't understand a word they said&mdash;not a
single word."</p>

<p>"Well, now, I be ding-busted!  How do dat come?"</p>

<p>"I don't know; but it's so.  I got some of their jabber out of
a book. S'pose a man was to come to you and say
Polly-voo-franzy&mdash;what would you think?"</p>

<p>"I wouldn' think nuff'n; I'd take en bust him over de
head&mdash;dat is, if he warn't white.  I wouldn't 'low no nigger
to call me dat."</p>

<p>"Shucks, it ain't calling you anything.  It's only saying, do
you know how to talk French?"</p>

<p>"Well, den, why couldn't he SAY it?"</p>

<p>"Why, he IS a-saying it.  That's a Frenchman's WAY of saying
it."</p>

<p>"Well, it's a blame ridicklous way, en I doan' want to hear no
mo' 'bout it.  Dey ain' no sense in it."</p>

<p>"Looky here, Jim; does a cat talk like we do?"</p>

<p>"No, a cat don't."</p>

<p>"Well, does a cow?"</p>

<p>"No, a cow don't, nuther."</p>

<p>"Does a cat talk like a cow, or a cow talk like a cat?"</p>

<p>"No, dey don't."</p>

<p>"It's natural and right for 'em to talk different from each
other, ain't it?"</p>

<p>"Course."</p>

<p>"And ain't it natural and right for a cat and a cow to talk
different from US?"</p>

<p>"Why, mos' sholy it is."</p>

<p>"Well, then, why ain't it natural and right for a FRENCHMAN to
talk different from us?  You answer me that."</p>

<p>"Is a cat a man, Huck?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"Well, den, dey ain't no sense in a cat talkin' like a man.
 Is a cow a man?&mdash;er is a cow a cat?"</p>

<p>"No, she ain't either of them."</p>

<p>"Well, den, she ain't got no business to talk like either one
er the yuther of 'em.  Is a Frenchman a man?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"WELL, den!  Dad blame it, why doan' he TALK like a man?  You
answer me DAT!"</p>

<p>I see it warn't no use wasting words&mdash;you can't learn a
nigger to argue. So I quit.</p>

CHAPTER XV.</p>

<p>WE judged that three nights more would fetch us to Cairo, at
the bottom of Illinois, where the Ohio River comes in, and that
was what we was after.  We would sell the raft and get on a
steamboat and go way up the Ohio amongst the free States, and
then be out of trouble.</p>

<p>Well, the second night a fog begun to come on, and we made for
a towhead to tie to, for it wouldn't do to try to run in a fog;
but when I paddled ahead in the canoe, with the line to make
fast, there warn't anything but little saplings to tie to.  I
passed the line around one of them right on the edge of the cut
bank, but there was a stiff current, and the raft come booming
down so lively she tore it out by the roots and away she went.  I
see the fog closing down, and it made me so sick and scared I
couldn't budge for most a half a minute it seemed to me&mdash;and
then there warn't no raft in sight; you couldn't see twenty
yards.  I jumped into the canoe and run back to the stern, and
grabbed the paddle and set her back a stroke.  But she didn't
come.  I was in such a hurry I hadn't untied her.  I got up and
tried to untie her, but I was so excited my hands shook so I
couldn't hardly do anything with them.</p>

<p>As soon as I got started I took out after the raft, hot and
heavy, right down the towhead.  That was all right as far as it
went, but the towhead warn't sixty yards long, and the minute I
flew by the foot of it I shot out into the solid white fog, and
hadn't no more idea which way I was going than a dead man.</p>

<p>Thinks I, it won't do to paddle; first I know I'll run into
the bank or a towhead or something; I got to set still and float,
and yet it's mighty fidgety business to have to hold your hands
still at such a time.  I whooped and listened.  Away down there
somewheres I hears a small whoop, and up comes my spirits.  I
went tearing after it, listening sharp to hear it again.  The
next time it come I see I warn't heading for it, but heading away
to the right of it.  And the next time I was heading away to the
left of it&mdash;and not gaining on it much either, for I was
flying around, this way and that and t'other, but it was going
straight ahead all the time.</p>

<p>I did wish the fool would think to beat a tin pan, and beat it
all the time, but he never did, and it was the still places
between the whoops that was making the trouble for me.  Well, I
fought along, and directly I hears the whoop BEHIND me.  I was
tangled good now.  That was somebody else's whoop, or else I was
turned around.</p>

<p>I throwed the paddle down.  I heard the whoop again; it was
behind me yet, but in a different place; it kept coming, and kept
changing its place, and I kept answering, till by and by it was
in front of me again, and I knowed the current had swung the
canoe's head down-stream, and I was all right if that was Jim and
not some other raftsman hollering.  I couldn't tell nothing about
voices in a fog, for nothing don't look natural nor sound natural
in a fog.</p>

<p>The whooping went on, and in about a minute I come a-booming
down on a cut bank with smoky ghosts of big trees on it, and the
current throwed me off to the left and shot by, amongst a lot of
snags that fairly roared, the currrent was tearing by them so
swift.</p>

<p>In another second or two it was solid white and still again.
 I set perfectly still then, listening to my heart thump, and I
reckon I didn't draw a breath while it thumped a hundred.</p>

<p>I just give up then.  I knowed what the matter was.  That cut
bank was an island, and Jim had gone down t'other side of it.  It
warn't no towhead that you could float by in ten minutes.  It had
the big timber of a regular island; it might be five or six miles
long and more than half a mile wide.</p>

<p>I kept quiet, with my ears cocked, about fifteen minutes, I
reckon.  I was floating along, of course, four or five miles an
hour; but you don't ever think of that.  No, you FEEL like you
are laying dead still on the water; and if a little glimpse of a
snag slips by you don't think to yourself how fast YOU'RE going,
but you catch your breath and think, my! how that snag's tearing
along.  If you think it ain't dismal and lonesome out in a fog
that way by yourself in the night, you try it once&mdash;you'll
see.</p>

<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>


<p>Next, for about a half an hour, I whoops now and then; at last
I hears the answer a long ways off, and tries to follow it, but I
couldn't do it, and directly I judged I'd got into a nest of
towheads, for I had little dim glimpses of them on both sides of
me&mdash;sometimes just a narrow channel between, and some that I
couldn't see I knowed was there because I'd hear the wash of the
current against the old dead brush and trash that hung over the
banks.  Well, I warn't long loosing the whoops down amongst the
towheads; and I only tried to chase them a little while, anyway,
because it was worse than chasing a Jack-o'-lantern.  You never
knowed a sound dodge around so, and swap places so quick and so
much.</p>

<p>I had to claw away from the bank pretty lively four or five
times, to keep from knocking the islands out of the river; and so
I judged the raft must be butting into the bank every now and
then, or else it would get further ahead and clear out of
hearing&mdash;it was floating a little faster than what I
was.</p>

<p>Well, I seemed to be in the open river again by and by, but I
couldn't hear no sign of a whoop nowheres.  I reckoned Jim had
fetched up on a snag, maybe, and it was all up with him.  I was
good and tired, so I laid down in the canoe and said I wouldn't
bother no more.  I didn't want to go to sleep, of course; but I
was so sleepy I couldn't help it; so I thought I would take jest
one little cat-nap.</p>


<br>

<a name="c15-118"></a>

<img alt="c15-118.jpg (78K)" src="images/c15-118.jpg" height="451" width="616">
</center>

<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

<p>But I reckon it was more than a cat-nap, for when I waked up
the stars was shining bright, the fog was all gone, and I was
spinning down a big bend stern first.  First I didn't know where
I was; I thought I was dreaming; and when things began to come
back to me they seemed to come up dim out of last week.</p>

<p>It was a monstrous big river here, with the tallest and the
thickest kind of timber on both banks; just a solid wall, as well
as I could see by the stars.  I looked away down-stream, and seen
a black speck on the water. I took after it; but when I got to it
it warn't nothing but a couple of sawlogs made fast together.
 Then I see another speck, and chased that; then another, and
this time I was right.  It was the raft.</p>

<p>When I got to it Jim was setting there with his head down
between his knees, asleep, with his right arm hanging over the
steering-oar.  The other oar was smashed off, and the raft was
littered up with leaves and branches and dirt.  So she'd had a
rough time.</p>

<p>I made fast and laid down under Jim's nose on the raft, and
began to gap, and stretch my fists out against Jim, and says:</p>

<p>"Hello, Jim, have I been asleep?  Why didn't you stir me
up?"</p>

<p>"Goodness gracious, is dat you, Huck?  En you ain'
dead&mdash;you ain' drownded&mdash;you's back agin?  It's too
good for true, honey, it's too good for true. Lemme look at you
chile, lemme feel o' you.  No, you ain' dead! you's back agin,
'live en soun', jis de same ole Huck&mdash;de same ole Huck,
thanks to goodness!"</p>

<p>"What's the matter with you, Jim?  You been a-drinking?"</p>

<p>"Drinkin'?  Has I ben a-drinkin'?  Has I had a chance to be
a-drinkin'?"</p>

<p>"Well, then, what makes you talk so wild?"</p>

<p>"How does I talk wild?"</p>

<p>"HOW?  Why, hain't you been talking about my coming back, and
all that stuff, as if I'd been gone away?"</p>

<p>"Huck&mdash;Huck Finn, you look me in de eye; look me in de
eye.  HAIN'T you ben gone away?"</p>

<p>"Gone away?  Why, what in the nation do you mean?  I hain't
been gone anywheres.  Where would I go to?"</p>

<p>"Well, looky here, boss, dey's sumf'n wrong, dey is.  Is I ME,
or who IS I? Is I heah, or whah IS I?  Now dat's what I wants to
know."</p>

<p>"Well, I think you're here, plain enough, but I think you're a
tangle-headed old fool, Jim."</p>

<p>"I is, is I?  Well, you answer me dis:  Didn't you tote out de
line in de canoe fer to make fas' to de tow-head?"</p>

<p>"No, I didn't.  What tow-head?  I hain't see no tow-head."</p>

<p>"You hain't seen no towhead?  Looky here, didn't de line pull
loose en de raf' go a-hummin' down de river, en leave you en de
canoe behine in de fog?"</p>

<p>"What fog?"</p>

<p>"Why, de fog!&mdash;de fog dat's been aroun' all night.  En
didn't you whoop, en didn't I whoop, tell we got mix' up in de
islands en one un us got los' en t'other one was jis' as good as
los', 'kase he didn' know whah he wuz? En didn't I bust up agin a
lot er dem islands en have a turrible time en mos' git drownded?
 Now ain' dat so, boss&mdash;ain't it so?  You answer me
dat."</p>

<p>"Well, this is too many for me, Jim.  I hain't seen no fog,
nor no islands, nor no troubles, nor nothing.  I been setting
here talking with you all night till you went to sleep about ten
minutes ago, and I reckon I done the same.  You couldn't a got
drunk in that time, so of course you've been dreaming."</p>

<p>"Dad fetch it, how is I gwyne to dream all dat in ten
minutes?"</p>

<p>"Well, hang it all, you did dream it, because there didn't any
of it happen."</p>

<p>"But, Huck, it's all jis' as plain to me as&mdash;"</p>

<p>"It don't make no difference how plain it is; there ain't
nothing in it. I know, because I've been here all the time."</p>

<p>Jim didn't say nothing for about five minutes, but set there
studying over it.  Then he says:</p>

<p>"Well, den, I reck'n I did dream it, Huck; but dog my cats ef
it ain't de powerfullest dream I ever see.  En I hain't ever had
no dream b'fo' dat's tired me like dis one."</p>

<p>"Oh, well, that's all right, because a dream does tire a body
like everything sometimes.  But this one was a staving dream;
tell me all about it, Jim."</p>

<p>So Jim went to work and told me the whole thing right through,
just as it happened, only he painted it up considerable.  Then he
said he must start in and "'terpret" it, because it was sent for
a warning.  He said the first towhead stood for a man that would
try to do us some good, but the current was another man that
would get us away from him.  The whoops was warnings that would
come to us every now and then, and if we didn't try hard to make
out to understand them they'd just take us into bad luck, 'stead
of keeping us out of it.  The lot of towheads was troubles we was
going to get into with quarrelsome people and all kinds of mean
folks, but if we minded our business and didn't talk back and
aggravate them, we would pull through and get out of the fog and
into the big clear river, which was the free States, and wouldn't
have no more trouble.</p>

<p>It had clouded up pretty dark just after I got on to the raft,
but it was clearing up again now.</p>

<p>"Oh, well, that's all interpreted well enough as far as it
goes, Jim," I says; "but what does THESE things stand for?"</p>

<p>It was the leaves and rubbish on the raft and the smashed oar.
 You could see them first-rate now.</p>

<p>Jim looked at the trash, and then looked at me, and back at
the trash again.  He had got the dream fixed so strong in his
head that he couldn't seem to shake it loose and get the facts
back into its place again right away.  But when he did get the
thing straightened around he looked at me steady without ever
smiling, and says:</p>

<p>"What do dey stan' for?  I'se gwyne to tell you.  When I got
all wore out wid work, en wid de callin' for you, en went to
sleep, my heart wuz mos' broke bekase you wuz los', en I didn'
k'yer no' mo' what become er me en de raf'.  En when I wake up en
fine you back agin, all safe en soun', de tears come, en I could
a got down on my knees en kiss yo' foot, I's so thankful. En all
you wuz thinkin' 'bout wuz how you could make a fool uv ole Jim
wid a lie.  Dat truck dah is TRASH; en trash is what people is
dat puts dirt on de head er dey fren's en makes 'em ashamed."</p>

<p>Then he got up slow and walked to the wigwam, and went in
there without saying anything but that.  But that was enough.  It
made me feel so mean I could almost kissed HIS foot to get him to
take it back.</p>

<p>It was fifteen minutes before I could work myself up to go and
humble myself to a nigger; but I done it, and I warn't ever sorry
for it afterwards, neither.  I didn't do him no more mean tricks,
and I wouldn't done that one if I'd a knowed it would make him
feel that way.</p>
