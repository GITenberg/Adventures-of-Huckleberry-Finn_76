CHAPTER XXXI.</p>

<p>WE dasn't stop again at any town for days and days; kept right
along down the river.  We was down south in the warm weather now,
and a mighty long ways from home.  We begun to come to trees with
Spanish moss on them, hanging down from the limbs like long, gray
beards.  It was the first I ever see it growing, and it made the
woods look solemn and dismal.  So now the frauds reckoned they
was out of danger, and they begun to work the villages again.</p>

<p>First they done a lecture on temperance; but they didn't make
enough for them both to get drunk on.  Then in another village
they started a dancing-school; but they didn't know no more how
to dance than a kangaroo does; so the first prance they made the
general public jumped in and pranced them out of town.  Another
time they tried to go at yellocution; but they didn't yellocute
long till the audience got up and give them a solid good cussing,
and made them skip out.  They tackled missionarying, and
mesmerizing, and doctoring, and telling fortunes, and a little of
everything; but they couldn't seem to have no luck.  So at last
they got just about dead broke, and laid around the raft as she
floated along, thinking and thinking, and never saying nothing,
by the half a day at a time, and dreadful blue and desperate.</p>

<p>And at last they took a change and begun to lay their heads
together in the wigwam and talk low and confidential two or three
hours at a time. Jim and me got uneasy.  We didn't like the look
of it.  We judged they was studying up some kind of worse
deviltry than ever.  We turned it over and over, and at last we
made up our minds they was going to break into somebody's house
or store, or was going into the counterfeit-money business, or
something. So then we was pretty scared, and made up an agreement
that we wouldn't have nothing in the world to do with such
actions, and if we ever got the least show we would give them the
cold shake and clear out and leave them behind. Well, early one
morning we hid the raft in a good, safe place about two mile
below a little bit of a shabby village named Pikesville, and the
king he went ashore and told us all to stay hid whilst he went up
to town and smelt around to see if anybody had got any wind of
the Royal Nonesuch there yet. ("House to rob, you MEAN," says I
to myself; "and when you get through robbing it you'll come back
here and wonder what has become of me and Jim and the
raft&mdash;and you'll have to take it out in wondering.") And he
said if he warn't back by midday the duke and me would know it
was all right, and we was to come along.</p>

<p>So we stayed where we was.  The duke he fretted and sweated
around, and was in a mighty sour way.  He scolded us for
everything, and we couldn't seem to do nothing right; he found
fault with every little thing. Something was a-brewing, sure.  I
was good and glad when midday come and no king; we could have a
change, anyway&mdash;and maybe a chance for THE change on top of
it.  So me and the duke went up to the village, and hunted around
there for the king, and by and by we found him in the back room
of a little low doggery, very tight, and a lot of loafers
bullyragging him for sport, and he a-cussing and a-threatening
with all his might, and so tight he couldn't walk, and couldn't
do nothing to them.  The duke he begun to abuse him for an old
fool, and the king begun to sass back, and the minute they was
fairly at it I lit out and shook the reefs out of my hind legs,
and spun down the river road like a deer, for I see our chance;
and I made up my mind that it would be a long day before they
ever see me and Jim again.  I got down there all out of breath
but loaded up with joy, and sung out:</p>

<p>"Set her loose, Jim! we're all right now!"</p>

<p>But there warn't no answer, and nobody come out of the wigwam.
 Jim was gone!  I set up a shout&mdash;and then another&mdash;and
then another one; and run this way and that in the woods,
whooping and screeching; but it warn't no use&mdash;old Jim was
gone.  Then I set down and cried; I couldn't help it. But I
couldn't set still long.  Pretty soon I went out on the road,
trying to think what I better do, and I run across a boy walking,
and asked him if he'd seen a strange nigger dressed so and so,
and he says:</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Whereabouts?" says I.</p>

<p>"Down to Silas Phelps' place, two mile below here.  He's a
runaway nigger, and they've got him.  Was you looking for
him?"</p>

<p>"You bet I ain't!  I run across him in the woods about an hour
or two ago, and he said if I hollered he'd cut my livers
out&mdash;and told me to lay down and stay where I was; and I
done it.  Been there ever since; afeard to come out."</p>

<p>"Well," he says, "you needn't be afeard no more, becuz they've
got him. He run off f'm down South, som'ers."</p>

<p>"It's a good job they got him."</p>

<p>"Well, I RECKON!  There's two hunderd dollars reward on him.
 It's like picking up money out'n the road."</p>

<p>"Yes, it is&mdash;and I could a had it if I'd been big enough;
I see him FIRST. Who nailed him?"</p>

<br>
<br>
<br>

<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>


<p>"It was an old fellow&mdash;a stranger&mdash;and he sold out
his chance in him for forty dollars, becuz he's got to go up the
river and can't wait.  Think o' that, now!  You bet I'D wait, if
it was seven year."</p>

<p>"That's me, every time," says I.  "But maybe his chance ain't
worth no more than that, if he'll sell it so cheap.  Maybe
there's something ain't straight about it."</p>

<p>"But it IS, though&mdash;straight as a string.  I see the
handbill myself.  It tells all about him, to a dot&mdash;paints
him like a picture, and tells the plantation he's frum, below
NewrLEANS.  No-sirree-BOB, they ain't no trouble 'bout THAT
speculation, you bet you.  Say, gimme a chaw tobacker, won't
ye?"</p>

<p>I didn't have none, so he left.  I went to the raft, and set
down in the wigwam to think.  But I couldn't come to nothing.  I
thought till I wore my head sore, but I couldn't see no way out
of the trouble.  After all this long journey, and after all we'd
done for them scoundrels, here it was all come to nothing,
everything all busted up and ruined, because they could have the
heart to serve Jim such a trick as that, and make him a slave
again all his life, and amongst strangers, too, for forty dirty
dollars.</p>

<p>Once I said to myself it would be a thousand times better for
Jim to be a slave at home where his family was, as long as he'd
GOT to be a slave, and so I'd better write a letter to Tom Sawyer
and tell him to tell Miss Watson where he was.  But I soon give
up that notion for two things: she'd be mad and disgusted at his
rascality and ungratefulness for leaving her, and so she'd sell
him straight down the river again; and if she didn't, everybody
naturally despises an ungrateful nigger, and they'd make Jim feel
it all the time, and so he'd feel ornery and disgraced. And then
think of ME!  It would get all around that Huck Finn helped a
nigger to get his freedom; and if I was ever to see anybody from
that town again I'd be ready to get down and lick his boots for
shame.  That's just the way:  a person does a low-down thing, and
then he don't want to take no consequences of it. Thinks as long
as he can hide it, it ain't no disgrace.  That was my fix exactly.
The more I studied about this the more my conscience went to
grinding me, and the more wicked and low-down and ornery I got to
feeling. And at last, when it hit me all of a sudden that here
was the plain hand of Providence slapping me in the face and
letting me know my wickedness was being watched all the time from
up there in heaven, whilst I was stealing a poor old woman's
nigger that hadn't ever done me no harm, and now was showing me
there's One that's always on the lookout, and ain't a-going to
allow no such miserable doings to go only just so fur and no
further, I most dropped in my tracks I was so scared.  Well, I
tried the best I could to kinder soften it up somehow for myself
by saying I was brung up wicked, and so I warn't so much to
blame; but something inside of me kept saying, "There was the
Sunday-school, you could a gone to it; and if you'd a done it
they'd a learnt you there that people that acts as I'd been
acting about that nigger goes to everlasting fire."</p>

<p>It made me shiver.  And I about made up my mind to pray, and
see if I couldn't try to quit being the kind of a boy I was and
be better.  So I kneeled down.  But the words wouldn't come.  Why
wouldn't they?  It warn't no use to try and hide it from Him.
 Nor from ME, neither.  I knowed very well why they wouldn't
come.  It was because my heart warn't right; it was because I
warn't square; it was because I was playing double.  I was
letting ON to give up sin, but away inside of me I was holding on
to the biggest one of all.  I was trying to make my mouth SAY I
would do the right thing and the clean thing, and go and write to
that nigger's owner and tell where he was; but deep down in me I
knowed it was a lie, and He knowed it.  You can't pray a
lie&mdash;I found that out.</p>

<p>So I was full of trouble, full as I could be; and didn't know
what to do. At last I had an idea; and I says, I'll go and write
the letter&mdash;and then see if I can pray.  Why, it was
astonishing, the way I felt as light as a feather right straight
off, and my troubles all gone.  So I got a piece of paper and a
pencil, all glad and excited, and set down and wrote:</p>

<p>Miss Watson, your runaway nigger Jim is down here two mile
below Pikesville, and Mr. Phelps has got him and he will give him
up for the reward if you send.</p>

<p>HUCK FINN.</p>

<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

<p>I felt good and all washed clean of sin for the first time I
had ever felt so in my life, and I knowed I could pray now.  But
I didn't do it straight off, but laid the paper down and set
there thinking&mdash;thinking how good it was all this happened
so, and how near I come to being lost and going to hell.  And
went on thinking.  And got to thinking over our trip down the
river; and I see Jim before me all the time:  in the day and in
the night-time, sometimes moonlight, sometimes storms, and we
a-floating along, talking and singing and laughing.  But somehow I
couldn't seem to strike no places to harden me against him, but
only the other kind.  I'd see him standing my watch on top of
his'n, 'stead of calling me, so I could go on sleeping; and see
him how glad he was when I come back out of the fog; and when I
come to him again in the swamp, up there where the feud was; and
such-like times; and would always call me honey, and pet me and
do everything he could think of for me, and how good he always
was; and at last I struck the time I saved him by telling the men
we had small-pox aboard, and he was so grateful, and said I was
the best friend old Jim ever had in the world, and the ONLY one
he's got now; and then I happened to look around and see that
paper.</p>

<p>It was a close place.  I took it up, and held it in my hand.
 I was a-trembling, because I'd got to decide, forever, betwixt
two things, and I knowed it.  I studied a minute, sort of holding
my breath, and then says to myself:</p>

<p>"All right, then, I'll GO to hell"&mdash;and tore it up.</p>

<p>It was awful thoughts and awful words, but they was said.  And
I let them stay said; and never thought no more about reforming.
 I shoved the whole thing out of my head, and said I would take
up wickedness again, which was in my line, being brung up to it,
and the other warn't.  And for a starter I would go to work and
steal Jim out of slavery again; and if I could think up anything
worse, I would do that, too; because as long as I was in, and in
for good, I might as well go the whole hog.</p>

<p>Then I set to thinking over how to get at it, and turned over
some considerable many ways in my mind; and at last fixed up a
plan that suited me.  So then I took the bearings of a woody
island that was down the river a piece, and as soon as it was
fairly dark I crept out with my raft and went for it, and hid it
there, and then turned in.  I slept the night through, and got up
before it was light, and had my breakfast, and put on my store
clothes, and tied up some others and one thing or another in a
bundle, and took the canoe and cleared for shore.  I landed below
where I judged was Phelps's place, and hid my bundle in the
woods, and then filled up the canoe with water, and loaded rocks
into her and sunk her where I could find her again when I wanted
her, about a quarter of a mile below a little steam sawmill that
was on the bank.</p>

<p>Then I struck up the road, and when I passed the mill I see a
sign on it, "Phelps's Sawmill," and when I come to the
farm-houses, two or three hundred yards further along, I kept my
eyes peeled, but didn't see nobody around, though it was good
daylight now.  But I didn't mind, because I didn't want to see
nobody just yet&mdash;I only wanted to get the lay of the land.
According to my plan, I was going to turn up there from the
village, not from below.  So I just took a look, and shoved
along, straight for town. Well, the very first man I see when I
got there was the duke.  He was sticking up a bill for the Royal
Nonesuch&mdash;three-night performance&mdash;like that other
time.  They had the cheek, them frauds!  I was right on him
before I could shirk.  He looked astonished, and says:</p>

<p>"Hel-LO!  Where'd YOU come from?"  Then he says, kind of glad
and eager, "Where's the raft?&mdash;got her in a good place?"</p>

<p>I says:</p>

<p>"Why, that's just what I was going to ask your grace."</p>

<p>Then he didn't look so joyful, and says:</p>

<p>"What was your idea for asking ME?" he says.</p>

<p>"Well," I says, "when I see the king in that doggery yesterday
I says to myself, we can't get him home for hours, till he's
soberer; so I went a-loafing around town to put in the time and
wait.  A man up and offered me ten cents to help him pull a skiff
over the river and back to fetch a sheep, and so I went along;
but when we was dragging him to the boat, and the man left me
a-holt of the rope and went behind him to shove him along, he was
too strong for me and jerked loose and run, and we after him.  We
didn't have no dog, and so we had to chase him all over the
country till we tired him out.  We never got him till dark; then
we fetched him over, and I started down for the raft.  When I got
there and see it was gone, I says to myself, 'They've got into
trouble and had to leave; and they've took my nigger, which is
the only nigger I've got in the world, and now I'm in a strange
country, and ain't got no property no more, nor nothing, and no
way to make my living;' so I set down and cried.  I slept in the
woods all night.  But what DID become of the raft,
then?&mdash;and Jim&mdash;poor Jim!"</p>

<p>"Blamed if I know&mdash;that is, what's become of the raft.
 That old fool had made a trade and got forty dollars, and when
we found him in the doggery the loafers had matched half-dollars
with him and got every cent but what he'd spent for whisky; and
when I got him home late last night and found the raft gone, we
said, 'That little rascal has stole our raft and shook us, and
run off down the river.'"</p>

<p>"I wouldn't shake my NIGGER, would I?&mdash;the only nigger I
had in the world, and the only property."</p>

<p>"We never thought of that.  Fact is, I reckon we'd come to
consider him OUR nigger; yes, we did consider him
so&mdash;goodness knows we had trouble enough for him.  So when
we see the raft was gone and we flat broke, there warn't anything
for it but to try the Royal Nonesuch another shake. And I've
pegged along ever since, dry as a powder-horn.  Where's that ten
cents? Give it here."</p>

<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

<p>I had considerable money, so I give him ten cents, but begged
him to spend it for something to eat, and give me some, because
it was all the money I had, and I hadn't had nothing to eat since
yesterday.  He never said nothing.  The next minute he whirls on
me and says:</p>

<p>"Do you reckon that nigger would blow on us?  We'd skin him if
he done that!"</p>

<p>"How can he blow?  Hain't he run off?"</p>

<p>"No!  That old fool sold him, and never divided with me, and
the money's gone."</p>

<p>"SOLD him?"  I says, and begun to cry; "why, he was MY nigger,
and that was my money.  Where is he?&mdash;I want my nigger."</p>

<p>"Well, you can't GET your nigger, that's all&mdash;so dry up
your blubbering. Looky here&mdash;do you think YOU'D venture to
blow on us?  Blamed if I think I'd trust you.  Why, if you WAS to
blow on us&mdash;"</p>

<p>He stopped, but I never see the duke look so ugly out of his
eyes before. I went on a-whimpering, and says:</p>

<p>"I don't want to blow on nobody; and I ain't got no time to
blow, nohow. I got to turn out and find my nigger."</p>

<p>He looked kinder bothered, and stood there with his bills
fluttering on his arm, thinking, and wrinkling up his forehead.
 At last he says:</p>

<p>"I'll tell you something.  We got to be here three days.  If
you'll promise you won't blow, and won't let the nigger blow,
I'll tell you where to find him."</p>

<p>So I promised, and he says:</p>

<p>"A farmer by the name of Silas Ph&mdash;" and then he stopped.
 You see, he started to tell me the truth; but when he stopped
that way, and begun to study and think again, I reckoned he was
changing his mind.  And so he was. He wouldn't trust me; he
wanted to make sure of having me out of the way the whole three
days.  So pretty soon he says:</p>

<p>"The man that bought him is named Abram Foster&mdash;Abram G.
Foster&mdash;and he lives forty mile back here in the country, on
the road to Lafayette."</p>

<p>"All right," I says, "I can walk it in three days.  And I'll
start this very afternoon."</p>

<p>"No you wont, you'll start NOW; and don't you lose any time
about it, neither, nor do any gabbling by the way.  Just keep a
tight tongue in your head and move right along, and then you
won't get into trouble with US, d'ye hear?"</p>

<p>That was the order I wanted, and that was the one I played
for.  I wanted to be left free to work my plans.</p>

<p>"So clear out," he says; "and you can tell Mr. Foster whatever
you want to. Maybe you can get him to believe that Jim IS your
nigger&mdash;some idiots don't require documents&mdash;leastways
I've heard there's such down South here.  And when you tell him
the handbill and the reward's bogus, maybe he'll believe you when
you explain to him what the idea was for getting 'em out.  Go
'long now, and tell him anything you want to; but mind you don't
work your jaw any BETWEEN here and there."</p>

<br>
<br>

<p>So I left, and struck for the back country.  I didn't look
around, but I kinder felt like he was watching me.  But I knowed
I could tire him out at that.  I went straight out in the country
as much as a mile before I stopped; then I doubled back through
the woods towards Phelps'.  I reckoned I better start in on my
plan straight off without fooling around, because I wanted to
stop Jim's mouth till these fellows could get away.  I didn't
want no trouble with their kind.  I'd seen all I wanted to of
them, and wanted to get entirely shut of them.</p>

CHAPTER XXXII.</p>

<p>WHEN I got there it was all still and Sunday-like, and hot and
sunshiny; the hands was gone to the fields; and there was them
kind of faint dronings of bugs and flies in the air that makes it
seem so lonesome and like everybody's dead and gone; and if a
breeze fans along and quivers the leaves it makes you feel
mournful, because you feel like it's spirits
whispering&mdash;spirits that's been dead ever so many
years&mdash;and you always think they're talking about YOU.  As a
general thing it makes a body wish HE was dead, too, and done
with it all.</p>

<p>Phelps' was one of these little one-horse cotton plantations,
and they all look alike.  A rail fence round a two-acre yard; a
stile made out of logs sawed off and up-ended in steps, like
barrels of a different length, to climb over the fence with, and
for the women to stand on when they are going to jump on to a
horse; some sickly grass-patches in the big yard, but mostly it
was bare and smooth, like an old hat with the nap rubbed off; big
double log-house for the white folks&mdash;hewed logs, with the
chinks stopped up with mud or mortar, and these mud-stripes been
whitewashed some time or another; round-log kitchen, with a big
broad, open but roofed passage joining it to the house; log
smoke-house back of the kitchen; three little log nigger-cabins
in a row t'other side the smoke-house; one little hut all by
itself away down against the back fence, and some outbuildings
down a piece the other side; ash-hopper and big kettle to bile
soap in by the little hut; bench by the kitchen door, with bucket
of water and a gourd; hound asleep there in the sun; more hounds
asleep round about; about three shade trees away off in a corner;
some currant bushes and gooseberry bushes in one place by the
fence; outside of the fence a garden and a watermelon patch; then
the cotton fields begins, and after the fields the woods.</p>

<p>I went around and clumb over the back stile by the ash-hopper,
and started for the kitchen.  When I got a little ways I heard
the dim hum of a spinning-wheel wailing along up and sinking
along down again; and then I knowed for certain I wished I was
dead&mdash;for that IS the lonesomest sound in the whole
world.</p>

<p>I went right along, not fixing up any particular plan, but
just trusting to Providence to put the right words in my mouth
when the time come; for I'd noticed that Providence always did
put the right words in my mouth if I left it alone.</p>

<p>When I got half-way, first one hound and then another got up
and went for me, and of course I stopped and faced them, and kept
still.  And such another powwow as they made!  In a quarter of a
minute I was a kind of a hub of a wheel, as you may
say&mdash;spokes made out of dogs&mdash;circle of fifteen of them
packed together around me, with their necks and noses stretched
up towards me, a-barking and howling; and more a-coming; you
could see them sailing over fences and around corners from
everywheres.</p>

<p>A nigger woman come tearing out of the kitchen with a
rolling-pin in her hand, singing out, "Begone YOU Tige! you Spot!
begone sah!" and she fetched first one and then another of them a
clip and sent them howling, and then the rest followed; and the
next second half of them come back, wagging their tails around
me, and making friends with me.  There ain't no harm in a hound,
nohow.</p>

<p>And behind the woman comes a little nigger girl and two little
nigger boys without anything on but tow-linen shirts, and they
hung on to their mother's gown, and peeped out from behind her at
me, bashful, the way they always do.  And here comes the white
woman running from the house, about forty-five or fifty year old,
bareheaded, and her spinning-stick in her hand; and behind her
comes her little white children, acting the same way the little
niggers was doing.  She was smiling all over so she could hardly
stand&mdash;and says:</p>

<p>"It's YOU, at last!&mdash;AIN'T it?"</p>

<p>I out with a "Yes'm" before I thought.</p>

<br>

<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>


<p>She grabbed me and hugged me tight; and then gripped me by
both hands and shook and shook; and the tears come in her eyes,
and run down over; and she couldn't seem to hug and shake enough,
and kept saying, "You don't look as much like your mother as I
reckoned you would; but law sakes, I don't care for that, I'm so
glad to see you!  Dear, dear, it does seem like I could eat you
up!  Children, it's your cousin Tom!&mdash;tell him howdy."</p>

<p>But they ducked their heads, and put their fingers in their
mouths, and hid behind her.  So she run on:</p>

<p>"Lize, hurry up and get him a hot breakfast right
away&mdash;or did you get your breakfast on the boat?"</p>

<p>I said I had got it on the boat.  So then she started for the
house, leading me by the hand, and the children tagging after.
 When we got there she set me down in a split-bottomed chair, and
set herself down on a little low stool in front of me, holding
both of my hands, and says:</p>

<p>"Now I can have a GOOD look at you; and, laws-a-me, I've been
hungry for it a many and a many a time, all these long years, and
it's come at last! We been expecting you a couple of days and
more.  What kep' you?&mdash;boat get aground?"</p>

<p>"Yes'm&mdash;she&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Don't say yes'm&mdash;say Aunt Sally.  Where'd she get
aground?"</p>

<p>I didn't rightly know what to say, because I didn't know
whether the boat would be coming up the river or down.  But I go
a good deal on instinct; and my instinct said she would be coming
up&mdash;from down towards Orleans. That didn't help me much,
though; for I didn't know the names of bars down that way.  I see
I'd got to invent a bar, or forget the name of the one we got
aground on&mdash;or&mdash;Now I struck an idea, and fetched it
out:</p>

<p>"It warn't the grounding&mdash;that didn't keep us back but a
little.  We blowed out a cylinder-head."</p>

<p>"Good gracious! anybody hurt?"</p>

<p>"No'm.  Killed a nigger."</p>

<p>"Well, it's lucky; because sometimes people do get hurt.  Two
years ago last Christmas your uncle Silas was coming up from
Newrleans on the old Lally Rook, and she blowed out a
cylinder-head and crippled a man.  And I think he died
afterwards.  He was a Baptist.  Your uncle Silas knowed a family
in Baton Rouge that knowed his people very well.  Yes, I remember
now, he DID die.  Mortification set in, and they had to amputate
him. But it didn't save him.  Yes, it was
mortification&mdash;that was it.  He turned blue all over, and
died in the hope of a glorious resurrection. They say he was a
sight to look at.  Your uncle's been up to the town every day to
fetch you. And he's gone again, not more'n an hour ago; he'll be
back any minute now. You must a met him on the road, didn't
you?&mdash;oldish man, with a&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No, I didn't see nobody, Aunt Sally.  The boat landed just at
daylight, and I left my baggage on the wharf-boat and went
looking around the town and out a piece in the country, to put in
the time and not get here too soon; and so I come down the back
way."</p>

<p>"Who'd you give the baggage to?"</p>

<p>"Nobody."</p>

<p>"Why, child, it 'll be stole!"</p>

<p>"Not where I hid it I reckon it won't," I says.</p>

<p>"How'd you get your breakfast so early on the boat?"</p>

<p>It was kinder thin ice, but I says:</p>

<p>"The captain see me standing around, and told me I better have
something to eat before I went ashore; so he took me in the texas
to the officers' lunch, and give me all I wanted."</p>

<p>I was getting so uneasy I couldn't listen good.  I had my mind
on the children all the time; I wanted to get them out to one
side and pump them a little, and find out who I was.  But I
couldn't get no show, Mrs. Phelps kept it up and run on so.
 Pretty soon she made the cold chills streak all down my back,
because she says:</p>

<p>"But here we're a-running on this way, and you hain't told me
a word about Sis, nor any of them.  Now I'll rest my works a
little, and you start up yourn; just tell me
EVERYTHING&mdash;tell me all about 'm all every one of 'm; and
how they are, and what they're doing, and what they told you to
tell me; and every last thing you can think of."</p>

<p>Well, I see I was up a stump&mdash;and up it good.  Providence
had stood by me this fur all right, but I was hard and tight
aground now.  I see it warn't a bit of use to try to go
ahead&mdash;I'd got to throw up my hand.  So I says to myself,
here's another place where I got to resk the truth.  I opened my
mouth to begin; but she grabbed me and hustled me in behind the
bed, and says:</p>

<p>"Here he comes!  Stick your head down lower&mdash;there,
that'll do; you can't be seen now.  Don't you let on you're here.
 I'll play a joke on him. Children, don't you say a word."</p>

<p>I see I was in a fix now.  But it warn't no use to worry;
there warn't nothing to do but just hold still, and try and be
ready to stand from under when the lightning struck.</p>

<p>I had just one little glimpse of the old gentleman when he
come in; then the bed hid him.  Mrs. Phelps she jumps for him,
and says:</p>

<p>"Has he come?"</p>

<p>"No," says her husband.</p>

<p>"Good-NESS gracious!" she says, "what in the warld can have
become of him?"</p>

<p>"I can't imagine," says the old gentleman; "and I must say it
makes me dreadful uneasy."</p>

<p>"Uneasy!" she says; "I'm ready to go distracted!  He MUST a
come; and you've missed him along the road.  I KNOW it's
so&mdash;something tells me so."</p>

<p>"Why, Sally, I COULDN'T miss him along the road&mdash;YOU know
that."</p>

<p>"But oh, dear, dear, what WILL Sis say!  He must a come!  You
must a missed him.  He&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, don't distress me any more'n I'm already distressed.  I
don't know what in the world to make of it.  I'm at my wit's end,
and I don't mind acknowledging 't I'm right down scared.  But
there's no hope that he's come; for he COULDN'T come and me miss
him.  Sally, it's terrible&mdash;just terrible&mdash;something's
happened to the boat, sure!"</p>

<p>"Why, Silas!  Look yonder!&mdash;up the road!&mdash;ain't that
somebody coming?"</p>

<p>He sprung to the window at the head of the bed, and that give
Mrs. Phelps the chance she wanted.  She stooped down quick at the
foot of the bed and give me a pull, and out I come; and when he
turned back from the window there she stood, a-beaming and
a-smiling like a house afire, and I standing pretty meek and
sweaty alongside.  The old gentleman stared, and says:</p>

<p>"Why, who's that?"</p>

<p>"Who do you reckon 't is?"</p>

<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>


<p>"I hain't no idea.  Who IS it?"</p>

<p>"It's TOM SAWYER!"</p>

<p>By jings, I most slumped through the floor!  But there warn't
no time to swap knives; the old man grabbed me by the hand and
shook, and kept on shaking; and all the time how the woman did
dance around and laugh and cry; and then how they both did fire
off questions about Sid, and Mary, and the rest of the tribe.</p>

<p>But if they was joyful, it warn't nothing to what I was; for
it was like being born again, I was so glad to find out who I
was.  Well, they froze to me for two hours; and at last, when my
chin was so tired it couldn't hardly go any more, I had told them
more about my family&mdash;I mean the Sawyer family&mdash;than
ever happened to any six Sawyer families.  And I explained all
about how we blowed out a cylinder-head at the mouth of White
River, and it took us three days to fix it.  Which was all right,
and worked first-rate; because THEY didn't know but what it would
take three days to fix it.  If I'd a called it a bolthead it
would a done just as well.</p>

<p>Now I was feeling pretty comfortable all down one side, and
pretty uncomfortable all up the other.  Being Tom Sawyer was easy
and comfortable, and it stayed easy and comfortable till by and
by I hear a steamboat coughing along down the river.  Then I says
to myself, s'pose Tom Sawyer comes down on that boat?  And s'pose
he steps in here any minute, and sings out my name before I can
throw him a wink to keep quiet?</p>

<p>Well, I couldn't HAVE it that way; it wouldn't do at all.  I
must go up the road and waylay him.  So I told the folks I
reckoned I would go up to the town and fetch down my baggage.
 The old gentleman was for going along with me, but I said no, I
could drive the horse myself, and I druther he wouldn't take no
trouble about me.</p>

CHAPTER XXXIII.</p>

<p>SO I started for town in the wagon, and when I was half-way I
see a wagon coming, and sure enough it was Tom Sawyer, and I
stopped and waited till he come along.  I says "Hold on!" and it
stopped alongside, and his mouth opened up like a trunk, and
stayed so; and he swallowed two or three times like a person
that's got a dry throat, and then says:</p>

<p>"I hain't ever done you no harm.  You know that.  So, then,
what you want to come back and ha'nt ME for?"</p>

<p>I says:</p>

<p>"I hain't come back&mdash;I hain't been GONE."</p>

<p>When he heard my voice it righted him up some, but he warn't
quite satisfied yet.  He says:</p>

<p>"Don't you play nothing on me, because I wouldn't on you.
 Honest injun now, you ain't a ghost?"</p>

<p>"Honest injun, I ain't," I says.</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;I&mdash;I&mdash;well, that ought to settle it, of
course; but I can't somehow seem to understand it no way.  Looky
here, warn't you ever murdered AT ALL?"</p>

<p>"No.  I warn't ever murdered at all&mdash;I played it on them.
 You come in here and feel of me if you don't believe me."</p>

<p>So he done it; and it satisfied him; and he was that glad to
see me again he didn't know what to do.  And he wanted to know
all about it right off, because it was a grand adventure, and
mysterious, and so it hit him where he lived.  But I said, leave
it alone till by and by; and told his driver to wait, and we
drove off a little piece, and I told him the kind of a fix I was
in, and what did he reckon we better do?  He said, let him alone
a minute, and don't disturb him.  So he thought and thought, and
pretty soon he says:</p>

<p>"It's all right; I've got it.  Take my trunk in your wagon,
and let on it's your'n; and you turn back and fool along slow, so
as to get to the house about the time you ought to; and I'll go
towards town a piece, and take a fresh start, and get there a
quarter or a half an hour after you; and you needn't let on to
know me at first."</p>

<p>I says:</p>

<p>"All right; but wait a minute.  There's one more thing&mdash;a
thing that NOBODY don't know but me.  And that is, there's a
nigger here that I'm a-trying to steal out of slavery, and his
name is JIM&mdash;old Miss Watson's Jim."</p>

<p>He says:</p>

<p>"What!  Why, Jim is&mdash;"</p>

<p>He stopped and went to studying.  I says:</p>

<p>"I know what you'll say.  You'll say it's dirty, low-down
business; but what if it is?  I'm low down; and I'm a-going to
steal him, and I want you keep mum and not let on.  Will
you?"</p>

<p>His eye lit up, and he says:</p>

<p>"I'll HELP you steal him!"</p>

<p>Well, I let go all holts then, like I was shot.  It was the
most astonishing speech I ever heard&mdash;and I'm bound to say
Tom Sawyer fell considerable in my estimation.  Only I couldn't
believe it.  Tom Sawyer a NIGGER-STEALER!</p>

<p>"Oh, shucks!"  I says; "you're joking."</p>

<p>"I ain't joking, either."</p>

<p>"Well, then," I says, "joking or no joking, if you hear
anything said about a runaway nigger, don't forget to remember
that YOU don't know nothing about him, and I don't know nothing
about him."</p>

<p>Then we took the trunk and put it in my wagon, and he drove
off his way and I drove mine.  But of course I forgot all about
driving slow on accounts of being glad and full of thinking; so I
got home a heap too quick for that length of a trip.  The old
gentleman was at the door, and he says:</p>

<p>"Why, this is wonderful!  Whoever would a thought it was in
that mare to do it?  I wish we'd a timed her.  And she hain't
sweated a hair&mdash;not a hair. It's wonderful.  Why, I wouldn't
take a hundred dollars for that horse now&mdash;I wouldn't,
honest; and yet I'd a sold her for fifteen before, and thought
'twas all she was worth."</p>

<p>That's all he said.  He was the innocentest, best old soul I
ever see. But it warn't surprising; because he warn't only just a
farmer, he was a preacher, too, and had a little one-horse log
church down back of the plantation, which he built it himself at
his own expense, for a church and schoolhouse, and never charged
nothing for his preaching, and it was worth it, too.  There was
plenty other farmer-preachers like that, and done the same way,
down South.</p>

<p>In about half an hour Tom's wagon drove up to the front stile,
and Aunt Sally she see it through the window, because it was only
about fifty yards, and says:</p>

<p>"Why, there's somebody come!  I wonder who 'tis?  Why, I do
believe it's a stranger.  Jimmy" (that's one of the children)
"run and tell Lize to put on another plate for dinner."</p>

<p>Everybody made a rush for the front door, because, of course,
a stranger don't come EVERY year, and so he lays over the
yaller-fever, for interest, when he does come.  Tom was over the
stile and starting for the house; the wagon was spinning up the
road for the village, and we was all bunched in the front door.
 Tom had his store clothes on, and an audience&mdash;and that was
always nuts for Tom Sawyer.  In them circumstances it warn't no
trouble to him to throw in an amount of style that was suitable.
 He warn't a boy to meeky along up that yard like a sheep; no, he
come ca'm and important, like the ram.  When he got a-front of us
he lifts his hat ever so gracious and dainty, like it was the lid
of a box that had butterflies asleep in it and he didn't want to
disturb them, and says:</p>

<p>"Mr. Archibald Nichols, I presume?"</p>


<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<a name="c33-287"></a>
<br>
<br>
<center>
<img alt="c33-287.jpg (42K)" src="images/c33-287.jpg" height="504" width="380">
</center>

<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

<p>"No, my boy," says the old gentleman, "I'm sorry to say 't
your driver has deceived you; Nichols's place is down a matter of
three mile more. Come in, come in."</p>

<p>Tom he took a look back over his shoulder, and says, "Too
late&mdash;he's out of sight."</p>

<p>"Yes, he's gone, my son, and you must come in and eat your
dinner with us; and then we'll hitch up and take you down to
Nichols's."</p>

<p>"Oh, I CAN'T make you so much trouble; I couldn't think of it.
 I'll walk&mdash;I don't mind the distance."</p>

<p>"But we won't LET you walk&mdash;it wouldn't be Southern
hospitality to do it. Come right in."</p>

<p>"Oh, DO," says Aunt Sally; "it ain't a bit of trouble to us,
not a bit in the world.  You must stay.  It's a long, dusty three
mile, and we can't let you walk.  And, besides, I've already told
'em to put on another plate when I see you coming; so you mustn't
disappoint us.  Come right in and make yourself at home."</p>

<p>So Tom he thanked them very hearty and handsome, and let
himself be persuaded, and come in; and when he was in he said he
was a stranger from Hicksville, Ohio, and his name was William
Thompson&mdash;and he made another bow.</p>

<p>Well, he run on, and on, and on, making up stuff about
Hicksville and everybody in it he could invent, and I getting a
little nervious, and wondering how this was going to help me out
of my scrape; and at last, still talking along, he reached over
and kissed Aunt Sally right on the mouth, and then settled back
again in his chair comfortable, and was going on talking; but she
jumped up and wiped it off with the back of her hand, and
says:</p>

<p>"You owdacious puppy!"</p>

<p>He looked kind of hurt, and says:</p>

<p>"I'm surprised at you, m'am."</p>

<p>"You're s'rp&mdash;Why, what do you reckon I am?  I've a good
notion to take and&mdash;Say, what do you mean by kissing
me?"</p>

<p>He looked kind of humble, and says:</p>

<p>"I didn't mean nothing, m'am.  I didn't mean no harm.
 I&mdash;I&mdash;thought you'd like it."</p>

<p>"Why, you born fool!"  She took up the spinning stick, and it
looked like it was all she could do to keep from giving him a
crack with it.  "What made you think I'd like it?"</p>

<p>"Well, I don't know.  Only, they&mdash;they&mdash;told me you
would."</p>

<p>"THEY told you I would.  Whoever told you's ANOTHER lunatic.
 I never heard the beat of it.  Who's THEY?"</p>

<p>"Why, everybody.  They all said so, m'am."</p>

<p>It was all she could do to hold in; and her eyes snapped, and
her fingers worked like she wanted to scratch him; and she
says:</p>

<p>"Who's 'everybody'?  Out with their names, or ther'll be an
idiot short."</p>

<p>He got up and looked distressed, and fumbled his hat, and
says:</p>

<p>"I'm sorry, and I warn't expecting it.  They told me to.  They
all told me to.  They all said, kiss her; and said she'd like it.
 They all said it&mdash;every one of them.  But I'm sorry, m'am,
and I won't do it no more&mdash;I won't, honest."</p>

<p>"You won't, won't you?  Well, I sh'd RECKON you won't!"</p>

<p>"No'm, I'm honest about it; I won't ever do it
again&mdash;till you ask me."</p>

<p>"Till I ASK you!  Well, I never see the beat of it in my born
days!  I lay you'll be the Methusalem-numskull of creation before
ever I ask you&mdash;or the likes of you."</p>

<p>"Well," he says, "it does surprise me so.  I can't make it
out, somehow. They said you would, and I thought you would.
 But&mdash;" He stopped and looked around slow, like he wished he
could run across a friendly eye somewheres, and fetched up on the
old gentleman's, and says, "Didn't YOU think she'd like me to
kiss her, sir?"</p>

<p>"Why, no; I&mdash;I&mdash;well, no, I b'lieve I didn't."</p>

<p>Then he looks on around the same way to me, and says:</p>

<p>"Tom, didn't YOU think Aunt Sally 'd open out her arms and
say, 'Sid Sawyer&mdash;'"</p>

<p>"My land!" she says, breaking in and jumping for him, "you
impudent young rascal, to fool a body so&mdash;" and was going to
hug him, but he fended her off, and says:</p>

<p>"No, not till you've asked me first."</p>

<p>So she didn't lose no time, but asked him; and hugged him and
kissed him over and over again, and then turned him over to the
old man, and he took what was left.  And after they got a little
quiet again she says:</p>

<p>"Why, dear me, I never see such a surprise.  We warn't looking
for YOU at all, but only Tom.  Sis never wrote to me about
anybody coming but him."</p>

<p>"It's because it warn't INTENDED for any of us to come but
Tom," he says; "but I begged and begged, and at the last minute
she let me come, too; so, coming down the river, me and Tom
thought it would be a first-rate surprise for him to come here to
the house first, and for me to by and by tag along and drop in,
and let on to be a stranger.  But it was a mistake, Aunt Sally.
 This ain't no healthy place for a stranger to come."</p>

<p>"No&mdash;not impudent whelps, Sid.  You ought to had your
jaws boxed; I hain't been so put out since I don't know when.
 But I don't care, I don't mind the terms&mdash;I'd be willing to
stand a thousand such jokes to have you here. Well, to think of
that performance!  I don't deny it, I was most putrified with
astonishment when you give me that smack."</p>

<br>
<br>

<p>We had dinner out in that broad open passage betwixt the house
and the kitchen; and there was things enough on that table for
seven families&mdash;and all hot, too; none of your flabby,
tough meat that's laid in a cupboard in a damp cellar all night
and tastes like a hunk of old cold cannibal in the morning.
 Uncle Silas he asked a pretty long blessing over it, but it was
worth it; and it didn't cool it a bit, neither, the way I've seen
them kind of interruptions do lots of times.  There was a
considerable good deal of talk all the afternoon, and me and Tom
was on the lookout all the time; but it warn't no use, they
didn't happen to say nothing about any runaway nigger, and we was
afraid to try to work up to it.  But at supper, at night, one of
the little boys says:</p>

<p>"Pa, mayn't Tom and Sid and me go to the show?"</p>

<p>"No," says the old man, "I reckon there ain't going to be any;
and you couldn't go if there was; because the runaway nigger told
Burton and me all about that scandalous show, and Burton said he
would tell the people; so I reckon they've drove the owdacious
loafers out of town before this time."</p>

<p>So there it was!&mdash;but I couldn't help it.  Tom and me was
to sleep in the same room and bed; so, being tired, we bid
good-night and went up to bed right after supper, and clumb out
of the window and down the lightning-rod, and shoved for the
town; for I didn't believe anybody was going to give the king and
the duke a hint, and so if I didn't hurry up and give them one
they'd get into trouble sure.</p>

<p>On the road Tom he told me all about how it was reckoned I was
murdered, and how pap disappeared pretty soon, and didn't come
back no more, and what a stir there was when Jim run away; and I
told Tom all about our Royal Nonesuch rapscallions, and as much
of the raft voyage as I had time to; and as we struck into the
town and up through the the middle of it--it was as much as half-after eight,
then&mdash;here comes a raging rush of people
with torches, and an awful whooping and yelling, and banging tin
pans and blowing horns; and we jumped to one side to let them go
by; and as they went by I see they had the king and the duke
astraddle of a rail&mdash;that is, I knowed it WAS the king and
the duke, though they was all over tar and feathers, and didn't
look like nothing in the world that was human&mdash;just looked
like a couple of monstrous big soldier-plumes.  Well, it made me
sick to see it; and I was sorry for them poor pitiful rascals, it
seemed like I couldn't ever feel any hardness against them any
more in the world.  It was a dreadful thing to see.  Human beings
CAN be awful cruel to one another.</p>

<br>
<br>

<p>We see we was too late&mdash;couldn't do no good.  We asked
some stragglers about it, and they said everybody went to the
show looking very innocent; and laid low and kept dark till the
poor old king was in the middle of his cavortings on the stage;
then somebody give a signal, and the house rose up and went for
them.</p>

<p>So we poked along back home, and I warn't feeling so brash as
I was before, but kind of ornery, and humble, and to blame,
somehow&mdash;though I hadn't done nothing.  But that's always
the way; it don't make no difference whether you do right or
wrong, a person's conscience ain't got no sense, and just goes
for him anyway.  If I had a yaller dog that didn't know no more
than a person's conscience does I would pison him. It takes up
more room than all the rest of a person's insides, and yet ain't
no good, nohow.  Tom Sawyer he says the same.</p>

CHAPTER XXXIV.</p>

<p>WE stopped talking, and got to thinking.  By and by Tom
says:</p>

<p>"Looky here, Huck, what fools we are to not think of it
before!  I bet I know where Jim is."</p>

<p>"No!  Where?"</p>

<p>"In that hut down by the ash-hopper.  Why, looky here.  When
we was at dinner, didn't you see a nigger man go in there with
some vittles?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"What did you think the vittles was for?"</p>

<p>"For a dog."</p>

<p>"So 'd I. Well, it wasn't for a dog."</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>"Because part of it was watermelon."</p>

<p>"So it was&mdash;I noticed it.  Well, it does beat all that I
never thought about a dog not eating watermelon.  It shows how a
body can see and don't see at the same time."</p>

<p>"Well, the nigger unlocked the padlock when he went in, and he
locked it again when he came out.  He fetched uncle a key about
the time we got up from table&mdash;same key, I bet.  Watermelon
shows man, lock shows prisoner; and it ain't likely there's two
prisoners on such a little plantation, and where the people's all
so kind and good.  Jim's the prisoner.  All right&mdash;I'm glad
we found it out detective fashion; I wouldn't give shucks for any
other way.  Now you work your mind, and study out a plan to steal
Jim, and I will study out one, too; and we'll take the one we
like the best."</p>

<p>What a head for just a boy to have!  If I had Tom Sawyer's
head I wouldn't trade it off to be a duke, nor mate of a
steamboat, nor clown in a circus, nor nothing I can think of.  I
went to thinking out a plan, but only just to be doing something;
I knowed very well where the right plan was going to come from.
 Pretty soon Tom says:</p>

<p>"Ready?"</p>

<p>"Yes," I says.</p>

<p>"All right&mdash;bring it out."</p>

<p>"My plan is this," I says.  "We can easy find out if it's Jim
in there. Then get up my canoe to-morrow night, and fetch my raft
over from the island.  Then the first dark night that comes steal
the key out of the old man's britches after he goes to bed, and
shove off down the river on the raft with Jim, hiding daytimes
and running nights, the way me and Jim used to do before.
 Wouldn't that plan work?"</p>

<p>"WORK?  Why, cert'nly it would work, like rats a-fighting.
 But it's too blame' simple; there ain't nothing TO it.  What's
the good of a plan that ain't no more trouble than that?  It's as
mild as goose-milk.  Why, Huck, it wouldn't make no more talk
than breaking into a soap factory."</p>

<p>I never said nothing, because I warn't expecting nothing
different; but I knowed mighty well that whenever he got HIS plan
ready it wouldn't have none of them objections to it.</p>

<p>And it didn't.  He told me what it was, and I see in a minute
it was worth fifteen of mine for style, and would make Jim just
as free a man as mine would, and maybe get us all killed besides.
 So I was satisfied, and said we would waltz in on it.  I needn't
tell what it was here, because I knowed it wouldn't stay the way,
it was.  I knowed he would be changing it around every which way
as we went along, and heaving in new bullinesses wherever he got
a chance.  And that is what he done.</p>

<p>Well, one thing was dead sure, and that was that Tom Sawyer
was in earnest, and was actuly going to help steal that nigger
out of slavery. That was the thing that was too many for me.
 Here was a boy that was respectable and well brung up; and had a
character to lose; and folks at home that had characters; and he
was bright and not leather-headed; and knowing and not ignorant;
and not mean, but kind; and yet here he was, without any more
pride, or rightness, or feeling, than to stoop to this business,
and make himself a shame, and his family a shame, before
everybody.  I COULDN'T understand it no way at all.  It was
outrageous, and I knowed I ought to just up and tell him so; and
so be his true friend, and let him quit the thing right where he
was and save himself. And I DID start to tell him; but he shut me
up, and says:</p>

<p>"Don't you reckon I know what I'm about?  Don't I generly know
what I'm about?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Didn't I SAY I was going to help steal the nigger?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"WELL, then."</p>

<p>That's all he said, and that's all I said.  It warn't no use
to say any more; because when he said he'd do a thing, he always
done it.  But I couldn't make out how he was willing to go into
this thing; so I just let it go, and never bothered no more about
it.  If he was bound to have it so, I couldn't help it.</p>

<p>When we got home the house was all dark and still; so we went
on down to the hut by the ash-hopper for to examine it.  We went
through the yard so as to see what the hounds would do.  They
knowed us, and didn't make no more noise than country dogs is
always doing when anything comes by in the night.  When we got to
the cabin we took a look at the front and the two sides; and on
the side I warn't acquainted with&mdash;which was the north
side&mdash;we found a square window-hole, up tolerable high, with
just one stout board nailed across it.  I says:</p>

<p>"Here's the ticket.  This hole's big enough for Jim to get
through if we wrench off the board."</p>

<p>Tom says:</p>

<p>"It's as simple as tit-tat-toe, three-in-a-row, and as easy as
playing hooky.  I should HOPE we can find a way that's a little
more complicated than THAT, Huck Finn."</p>

<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>


<p>"Well, then," I says, "how 'll it do to saw him out, the way I
done before I was murdered that time?"</p>

<p>"That's more LIKE," he says.  "It's real mysterious, and
troublesome, and good," he says; "but I bet we can find a way
that's twice as long.  There ain't no hurry; le's keep on looking
around."</p>

<p>Betwixt the hut and the fence, on the back side, was a lean-to
that joined the hut at the eaves, and was made out of plank.  It
was as long as the hut, but narrow&mdash;only about six foot
wide.  The door to it was at the south end, and was padlocked.
 Tom he went to the soap-kettle and searched around, and fetched
back the iron thing they lift the lid with; so he took it and
prized out one of the staples.  The chain fell down, and we
opened the door and went in, and shut it, and struck a match, and
see the shed was only built against a cabin and hadn't no
connection with it; and there warn't no floor to the shed, nor
nothing in it but some old rusty played-out hoes and spades and
picks and a crippled plow.  The match went out, and so did we,
and shoved in the staple again, and the door was locked as good
as ever. Tom was joyful.  He says;</p>

<p>"Now we're all right.  We'll DIG him out.  It 'll take about a
week!"</p>

<p>Then we started for the house, and I went in the back
door&mdash;you only have to pull a buckskin latch-string, they
don't fasten the doors&mdash;but that warn't romantical enough
for Tom Sawyer; no way would do him but he must climb up the
lightning-rod.  But after he got up half way about three times,
and missed fire and fell every time, and the last time most
busted his brains out, he thought he'd got to give it up; but
after he was rested he allowed he would give her one more turn
for luck, and this time he made the trip.</p>

<p>In the morning we was up at break of day, and down to the
nigger cabins to pet the dogs and make friends with the nigger
that fed Jim&mdash;if it WAS Jim that was being fed.  The niggers
was just getting through breakfast and starting for the fields;
and Jim's nigger was piling up a tin pan with bread and meat and
things; and whilst the others was leaving, the key come from the
house.</p>

<p>This nigger had a good-natured, chuckle-headed face, and his
wool was all tied up in little bunches with thread.  That was to
keep witches off.  He said the witches was pestering him awful
these nights, and making him see all kinds of strange things, and
hear all kinds of strange words and noises, and he didn't believe
he was ever witched so long before in his life.  He got so worked
up, and got to running on so about his troubles, he forgot all
about what he'd been a-going to do.  So Tom says:</p>

<p>"What's the vittles for?  Going to feed the dogs?"</p>

<p>The nigger kind of smiled around gradually over his face, like
when you heave a brickbat in a mud-puddle, and he says:</p>

<p>"Yes, Mars Sid, A dog.  Cur'us dog, too.  Does you want to go
en look at 'im?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>I hunched Tom, and whispers:</p>

<p>"You going, right here in the daybreak?  THAT warn't the
plan."</p>

<p>"No, it warn't; but it's the plan NOW."</p>

<p>So, drat him, we went along, but I didn't like it much.  When
we got in we couldn't hardly see anything, it was so dark; but
Jim was there, sure enough, and could see us; and he sings
out:</p>

<p>"Why, HUCK!  En good LAN'! ain' dat Misto Tom?"</p>

<p>I just knowed how it would be; I just expected it.  I didn't
know nothing to do; and if I had I couldn't a done it, because
that nigger busted in and says:</p>

<p>"Why, de gracious sakes! do he know you genlmen?"</p>

<p>We could see pretty well now.  Tom he looked at the nigger,
steady and kind of wondering, and says:</p>

<p>"Does WHO know us?"</p>

<p>"Why, dis-yer runaway nigger."</p>

<p>"I don't reckon he does; but what put that into your
head?"</p>

<p>"What PUT it dar?  Didn' he jis' dis minute sing out like he
knowed you?"</p>

<p>Tom says, in a puzzled-up kind of way:</p>

<p>"Well, that's mighty curious.  WHO sung out? WHEN did he sing
out?  WHAT did he sing out?" And turns to me, perfectly ca'm, and
says, "Did YOU hear anybody sing out?"</p>

<p>Of course there warn't nothing to be said but the one thing;
so I says:</p>

<p>"No; I ain't heard nobody say nothing."</p>

<p>Then he turns to Jim, and looks him over like he never see him
before, and says:</p>

<p>"Did you sing out?"</p>

<p>"No, sah," says Jim; "I hain't said nothing, sah."</p>

<p>"Not a word?"</p>

<p>"No, sah, I hain't said a word."</p>

<p>"Did you ever see us before?"</p>

<p>"No, sah; not as I knows on."</p>

<p>So Tom turns to the nigger, which was looking wild and
distressed, and says, kind of severe:</p>

<p>"What do you reckon's the matter with you, anyway?  What made
you think somebody sung out?"</p>

<p>"Oh, it's de dad-blame' witches, sah, en I wisht I was dead, I
do.  Dey's awluz at it, sah, en dey do mos' kill me, dey sk'yers
me so.  Please to don't tell nobody 'bout it sah, er ole Mars
Silas he'll scole me; 'kase he say dey AIN'T no witches.  I jis'
wish to goodness he was heah now&mdash;DEN what would he say!  I
jis' bet he couldn' fine no way to git aroun' it DIS time.  But
it's awluz jis' so; people dat's SOT, stays sot; dey won't look
into noth'n'en fine it out f'r deyselves, en when YOU fine it out
en tell um 'bout it, dey doan' b'lieve you."</p>

<br>
<br>

<p>Tom give him a dime, and said we wouldn't tell nobody; and
told him to buy some more thread to tie up his wool with; and
then looks at Jim, and says:</p>

<p>"I wonder if Uncle Silas is going to hang this nigger.  If I
was to catch a nigger that was ungrateful enough to run away, I
wouldn't give him up, I'd hang him."  And whilst the nigger
stepped to the door to look at the dime and bite it to see if it
was good, he whispers to Jim and says:</p>

<p>"Don't ever let on to know us.  And if you hear any digging
going on nights, it's us; we're going to set you free."</p>

<p>Jim only had time to grab us by the hand and squeeze it; then
the nigger come back, and we said we'd come again some time if
the nigger wanted us to; and he said he would, more particular if
it was dark, because the witches went for him mostly in the dark,
and it was good to have folks around then.</p>

CHAPTER XXXV.</p>

<p>IT would be most an hour yet till breakfast, so we left and
struck down into the woods; because Tom said we got to have SOME
light to see how to dig by, and a lantern makes too much, and
might get us into trouble; what we must have was a lot of them
rotten chunks that's called fox-fire, and just makes a soft kind
of a glow when you lay them in a dark place.  We fetched an
armful and hid it in the weeds, and set down to rest, and Tom
says, kind of dissatisfied:</p>

<p>"Blame it, this whole thing is just as easy and awkward as it
can be. And so it makes it so rotten difficult to get up a
difficult plan.  There ain't no watchman to be drugged&mdash;now
there OUGHT to be a watchman.  There ain't even a dog to give a
sleeping-mixture to.  And there's Jim chained by one leg, with a
ten-foot chain, to the leg of his bed:  why, all you got to do is
to lift up the bedstead and slip off the chain.  And Uncle Silas
he trusts everybody; sends the key to the punkin-headed nigger,
and don't send nobody to watch the nigger.  Jim could a got out
of that window-hole before this, only there wouldn't be no use
trying to travel with a ten-foot chain on his leg.  Why, drat it,
Huck, it's the stupidest arrangement I ever see. You got to
invent ALL the difficulties.  Well, we can't help it; we got to
do the best we can with the materials we've got. Anyhow, there's
one thing&mdash;there's more honor in getting him out through a
lot of difficulties and dangers, where there warn't one of them
furnished to you by the people who it was their duty to furnish
them, and you had to contrive them all out of your own head.  Now
look at just that one thing of the lantern.  When you come down
to the cold facts, we simply got to LET ON that a lantern's
resky.  Why, we could work with a torchlight procession if we
wanted to, I believe.  Now, whilst I think of it, we got to hunt
up something to make a saw out of the first chance we get."</p>

<p>"What do we want of a saw?"</p>

<p>"What do we WANT of it?  Hain't we got to saw the leg of
Jim's bed off, so as to get the chain loose?"</p>

<p>"Why, you just said a body could lift up the bedstead and slip
the chain off."</p>

<p>"Well, if that ain't just like you, Huck Finn.  You CAN get up
the infant-schooliest ways of going at a thing.  Why, hain't you
ever read any books at all?&mdash;Baron Trenck, nor Casanova, nor
Benvenuto Chelleeny, nor Henri IV., nor none of them heroes?  Who
ever heard of getting a prisoner loose in such an old-maidy way
as that?  No; the way all the best authorities does is to saw the
bed-leg in two, and leave it just so, and swallow the sawdust, so
it can't be found, and put some dirt and grease around the sawed
place so the very keenest seneskal can't see no sign of it's
being sawed, and thinks the bed-leg is perfectly sound. Then, the
night you're ready, fetch the leg a kick, down she goes; slip off
your chain, and there you are.  Nothing to do but hitch your rope
ladder to the battlements, shin down it, break your leg in the
moat&mdash;because a rope ladder is nineteen foot too short, you
know&mdash;and there's your horses and your trusty vassles, and
they scoop you up and fling you across a saddle, and away you go
to your native Langudoc, or Navarre, or wherever it is. It's
gaudy, Huck.  I wish there was a moat to this cabin. If we get
time, the night of the escape, we'll dig one."</p>

<p>I says:</p>

<p>"What do we want of a moat when we're going to snake him out
from under the cabin?"</p>

<p>But he never heard me.  He had forgot me and everything else.
 He had his chin in his hand, thinking.  Pretty soon he sighs and
shakes his head; then sighs again, and says:</p>

<p>"No, it wouldn't do&mdash;there ain't necessity enough for
it."</p>

<p>"For what?"  I says.</p>

<p>"Why, to saw Jim's leg off," he says.</p>

<p>"Good land!"  I says; "why, there ain't NO necessity for it.
 And what would you want to saw his leg off for, anyway?"</p>

<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>


<p>"Well, some of the best authorities has done it.  They
couldn't get the chain off, so they just cut their hand off and
shoved.  And a leg would be better still.  But we got to let that
go.  There ain't necessity enough in this case; and, besides,
Jim's a nigger, and wouldn't understand the reasons for it, and
how it's the custom in Europe; so we'll let it go.  But there's
one thing&mdash;he can have a rope ladder; we can tear up our
sheets and make him a rope ladder easy enough.  And we can send
it to him in a pie; it's mostly done that way.  And I've et worse
pies."</p>

<p>"Why, Tom Sawyer, how you talk," I says; "Jim ain't got no use
for a rope ladder."</p>

<p>"He HAS got use for it.  How YOU talk, you better say; you
don't know nothing about it.  He's GOT to have a rope ladder;
they all do."</p>

<p>"What in the nation can he DO with it?"</p>

<p>"DO with it?  He can hide it in his bed, can't he?"  That's
what they all do; and HE'S got to, too.  Huck, you don't ever
seem to want to do anything that's regular; you want to be
starting something fresh all the time. S'pose he DON'T do nothing
with it? ain't it there in his bed, for a clew, after he's gone?
and don't you reckon they'll want clews?  Of course they will.
 And you wouldn't leave them any?  That would be a PRETTY
howdy-do, WOULDN'T it!  I never heard of such a thing."</p>

<p>"Well," I says, "if it's in the regulations, and he's got to
have it, all right, let him have it; because I don't wish to go
back on no regulations; but there's one thing, Tom
Sawyer&mdash;if we go to tearing up our sheets to make Jim a rope
ladder, we're going to get into trouble with Aunt Sally, just as
sure as you're born.  Now, the way I look at it, a hickry-bark
ladder don't cost nothing, and don't waste nothing, and is just
as good to load up a pie with, and hide in a straw tick, as any
rag ladder you can start; and as for Jim, he ain't had no
experience, and so he don't care what kind of a&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, shucks, Huck Finn, if I was as ignorant as you I'd keep
still&mdash;that's what I'D do.  Who ever heard of a state
prisoner escaping by a hickry-bark ladder?  Why, it's perfectly
ridiculous."</p>

<p>"Well, all right, Tom, fix it your own way; but if you'll take
my advice, you'll let me borrow a sheet off of the
clothesline."</p>

<p>He said that would do.  And that gave him another idea, and he
says:</p>

<p>"Borrow a shirt, too."</p>

<p>"What do we want of a shirt, Tom?"</p>

<p>"Want it for Jim to keep a journal on."</p>

<p>"Journal your granny&mdash;JIM can't write."</p>

<p>"S'pose he CAN'T write&mdash;he can make marks on the shirt,
can't he, if we make him a pen out of an old pewter spoon or a
piece of an old iron barrel-hoop?"</p>

<p>"Why, Tom, we can pull a feather out of a goose and make him a
better one; and quicker, too."</p>

<p>"PRISONERS don't have geese running around the donjon-keep to
pull pens out of, you muggins.  They ALWAYS make their pens out
of the hardest, toughest, troublesomest piece of old brass
candlestick or something like that they can get their hands on;
and it takes them weeks and weeks and months and months to file
it out, too, because they've got to do it by rubbing it on the
wall.  THEY wouldn't use a goose-quill if they had it. It ain't
regular."</p>

<p>"Well, then, what'll we make him the ink out of?"</p>

<p>"Many makes it out of iron-rust and tears; but that's the
common sort and women; the best authorities uses their own blood.
 Jim can do that; and when he wants to send any little common
ordinary mysterious message to let the world know where he's
captivated, he can write it on the bottom of a tin plate with a
fork and throw it out of the window.  The Iron Mask always done
that, and it's a blame' good way, too."</p>

<p>"Jim ain't got no tin plates.  They feed him in a pan."</p>

<p>"That ain't nothing; we can get him some."</p>

<p>"Can't nobody READ his plates."</p>

<p>"That ain't got anything to DO with it, Huck Finn.  All HE'S
got to do is to write on the plate and throw it out.  You don't
HAVE to be able to read it. Why, half the time you can't read
anything a prisoner writes on a tin plate, or anywhere else."</p>

<p>"Well, then, what's the sense in wasting the plates?"</p>

<p>"Why, blame it all, it ain't the PRISONER'S plates."</p>

<p>"But it's SOMEBODY'S plates, ain't it?"</p>

<p>"Well, spos'n it is?  What does the PRISONER care
whose&mdash;"</p>

<p>He broke off there, because we heard the breakfast-horn
blowing.  So we cleared out for the house.</p>

<p>Along during the morning I borrowed a sheet and a white shirt
off of the clothes-line; and I found an old sack and put them in
it, and we went down and got the fox-fire, and put that in too.
 I called it borrowing, because that was what pap always called
it; but Tom said it warn't borrowing, it was stealing.  He said
we was representing prisoners; and prisoners don't care how they
get a thing so they get it, and nobody don't blame them for it,
either.  It ain't no crime in a prisoner to steal the thing he
needs to get away with, Tom said; it's his right; and so, as long
as we was representing a prisoner, we had a perfect right to
steal anything on this place we had the least use for to get
ourselves out of prison with.  He said if we warn't prisoners it
would be a very different thing, and nobody but a mean, ornery
person would steal when he warn't a prisoner.  So we allowed we
would steal everything there was that come handy.  And yet he
made a mighty fuss, one day, after that, when I stole a
watermelon out of the nigger-patch and eat it; and he made me go
and give the niggers a dime without telling them what it was for.
Tom said that what he meant was, we could steal anything we
NEEDED. Well, I says, I needed the watermelon.  But he said I
didn't need it to get out of prison with; there's where the
difference was.  He said if I'd a wanted it to hide a knife in,
and smuggle it to Jim to kill the seneskal with, it would a been
all right.  So I let it go at that, though I couldn't see no
advantage in my representing a prisoner if I got to set down and
chaw over a lot of gold-leaf distinctions like that every time I
see a chance to hog a watermelon.</p>

<p>Well, as I was saying, we waited that morning till everybody
was settled down to business, and nobody in sight around the
yard; then Tom he carried the sack into the lean-to whilst I
stood off a piece to keep watch.  By and by he come out, and we
went and set down on the woodpile to talk.  He says:</p>

<p>"Everything's all right now except tools; and that's easy
fixed."</p>

<p>"Tools?"  I says.</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Tools for what?"</p>

<p>"Why, to dig with.  We ain't a-going to GNAW him out, are
we?"</p>

<p>"Ain't them old crippled picks and things in there good enough
to dig a nigger out with?"  I says.</p>

<p>He turns on me, looking pitying enough to make a body cry, and
says:</p>

<p>"Huck Finn, did you EVER hear of a prisoner having picks and
shovels, and all the modern conveniences in his wardrobe to dig
himself out with?  Now I want to ask you&mdash;if you got any
reasonableness in you at all&mdash;what kind of a show would THAT
give him to be a hero?  Why, they might as well lend him the key
and done with it.  Picks and shovels&mdash;why, they wouldn't
furnish 'em to a king."</p>

<p>"Well, then," I says, "if we don't want the picks and shovels,
what do we want?"</p>

<p>"A couple of case-knives."</p>

<p>"To dig the foundations out from under that cabin with?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Confound it, it's foolish, Tom."</p>

<p>"It don't make no difference how foolish it is, it's the RIGHT
way&mdash;and it's the regular way.  And there ain't no OTHER
way, that ever I heard of, and I've read all the books that gives
any information about these things. They always dig out with a
case-knife&mdash;and not through dirt, mind you; generly it's
through solid rock.  And it takes them weeks and weeks and weeks,
and for ever and ever.  Why, look at one of them prisoners in the
bottom dungeon of the Castle Deef, in the harbor of Marseilles,
that dug himself out that way; how long was HE at it, you
reckon?"</p>

<p>"I don't know."</p>

<p>"Well, guess."</p>

<p>"I don't know.  A month and a half."</p>

<p>"THIRTY-SEVEN YEAR&mdash;and he come out in China.  THAT'S the
kind.  I wish the bottom of THIS fortress was solid rock."</p>

<p>"JIM don't know nobody in China."</p>

<p>"What's THAT got to do with it?  Neither did that other
fellow.  But you're always a-wandering off on a side issue.  Why
can't you stick to the main point?"</p>

<p>"All right&mdash;I don't care where he comes out, so he COMES
out; and Jim don't, either, I reckon.  But there's one thing,
anyway&mdash;Jim's too old to be dug out with a case-knife.  He
won't last."</p>

<p>"Yes he will LAST, too.  You don't reckon it's going to take
thirty-seven years to dig out through a DIRT foundation, do
you?"</p>

<p>"How long will it take, Tom?"</p>

<p>"Well, we can't resk being as long as we ought to, because it
mayn't take very long for Uncle Silas to hear from down there by
New Orleans.  He'll hear Jim ain't from there.  Then his next
move will be to advertise Jim, or something like that.  So we
can't resk being as long digging him out as we ought to.  By
rights I reckon we ought to be a couple of years; but we can't.
 Things being so uncertain, what I recommend is this:  that we
really dig right in, as quick as we can; and after that, we can
LET ON, to ourselves, that we was at it thirty-seven years.  Then
we can snatch him out and rush him away the first time there's an
alarm.  Yes, I reckon that 'll be the best way."</p>

<p>"Now, there's SENSE in that," I says.  "Letting on don't cost
nothing; letting on ain't no trouble; and if it's any object, I
don't mind letting on we was at it a hundred and fifty year.  It
wouldn't strain me none, after I got my hand in.  So I'll mosey
along now, and smouch a couple of case-knives."</p>

<br>
<br>

<p>"Smouch three," he says; "we want one to make a saw out
of."</p>

<p>"Tom, if it ain't unregular and irreligious to sejest it," I
says, "there's an old rusty saw-blade around yonder sticking
under the weather-boarding behind the smoke-house."</p>

<p>He looked kind of weary and discouraged-like, and says:</p>

<p>"It ain't no use to try to learn you nothing, Huck.  Run along
and smouch the knives&mdash;three of them."  So I done it.</p>
